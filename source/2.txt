Introduction8    Introduction    Introduction   9Introduction
In July of 2021, famed chef Tom Colicchio 
made a decision to open a healthy restaurant in a children’s hospital. According to the Washington Post , “Root & Sprig, [is] a new 
fast-casual concept that aims to give patients, families, doctors and other healthcare workers a better meal when they’re at a hospital, whether working or recovering.”
1 Colicchio’s 
restaurant is one of the latest developments in the increasingly popular “food as medicine” movement, a philosophy arguing that the food we eat impacts our health by preventing and/or fighting disease.
There are a variety of key terms and phrases 
used to describe and discuss food as medicine, including but not limited to: food is 
medicine, culinary medicine, culinary nutrition, medically tailored meals, medically tailored groceries, medically tailored food packages, food for health, nutritious food referrals, prescription fruit and vegetable programs, using food for disease management, and community-level healthy food programs. There are a variety of definitions and phrases to describe the integration of food to prevent and or treat disease.   Using food for prevention and treatment of disease has a long history and documented efficacy.
2,3 In fact, evidence indicates that 
sustained dietary changes can be as effective as pharmacological interventions in treating certain diseases, especially in the early stages of the disease.
4,5 In some instances, a long-
term, specific diet may be more effective than medication at mitigating, stabilizing, and reversing disease.
6,7,8,9,10 Additionally, using 
drug treatments in combination with a healthy tailored diet may be more impactful than drugs alone; there are a plethora of  studies which demonstrate the extensive health benefits of food as medicine and indicate that the focus should not be on diet or medicine alone, but rather on diet and medicine.
11,12,13,14
In an interview  in the Harvard Health Policy 
Review about her research, Lisa Haushofer, 
MD, PhD, a senior research associate at the Institute for Biomedical Ethics and History of Medicine at the University of Zurich, discussed the boundaries between food and medicine, stating “one of the things I try to understand in my research is how nutrition came to be so marginalized in contemporary biomedicine and how instead it was absorbed increasingly by a nutritional consumer industry.”
15Impact of Poor Diet on Health, Disease, and 
Health Care Costs
There is overwhelming evidence 
demonstrating the impact of food and diet on health, specifically among food-related diseases.
16,17,18,19,20 Whether or not a poor diet 
can cause damage to the body should no longer be debated, as evidence supports the potential causal relationships between dietary factors and diet-related diseases such as ischemic heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers.
21,22,23,24,25,26,27 For example, researchers 
reporting in the journal PLOS Medicine found 
that a “[s]uboptimal diet of 10 dietary factors accounts for 18.2 percent of all ischemic heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes costs in the US.”
28 The ten factors these researchers 
studied were fruits, vegetables, nuts/seeds, whole grains, red meat, sugar-sweetened beverages, processed meat, polyunsaturated fatty acids, seafood omega-3, and sodium.
29
Unbalanced consumption habits of the aforementioned ten factors are estimated to cost Americans $50.4 billion in diet-related cardiometabolic disease expenses annually.
30
There is also evidence showing that the chemical structures and composition of food can have a significant impact on individual and population health - sugar, oils, saturated fats, pesticides, and processed foods are known to pose a wide variety of health risks and diseases.
31 Further, the increasing availability 
of ultra-processed foods coincides with the rise of obesity, chronic illness, and other diet-related diseases.
32 According to data from the 
CDC in 2018, 42.8 percent of American adults over 60, nearly 45 percent of adults aged 44-59 years, and 40 percent of young adults (age 20-39) are obese.
33 Additionally, 60 percent of 
Americans have an underlying health condition: 121.5 million adults have cardiovascular disease and over 34 million have diagnosed type 2 diabetes. As of 2020, an additional 88 million American adults have prediabetes.
34,35,36These diet-related diseases consume a significant portion of medical costs. In 2017, the total estimated cost of diagnosed diabetes alone was $327 billion in medical costs and lost productivity.
37,38 Obesity costs the United States 
roughly $147 billion a year,39 and heart disease 
and stroke together cost the health care system $214 billion per year and $138 billion in lost productivity in the workforce.
40 Estimates 
project that chronic diseases will cost more than $47 trillion in lost output between the years 2011 and 2030.
41 Additionally there is a 
significant socioeconomic disparity in health.42
Studies have shown that lower socioeconomic status has been linked to disproportionate access to adequate health care among a variety of diseases.
43 Individuals of lower 
socioeconomic status have higher rates of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, arthritis, diabetes, and cancer.
44 With this increased 
rate of disease comes an increase in mortality, especially beginning at middle age.
45
Poor diet has also been linked to increased morbidity and mortality across many diet-related diseases.
46 According to the Global 
Burden of Disease study  published by the 
Journal of the American Medical Association, poor diet is the number-one risk factor associated with morbidity and mortality in the United States.
47 A comparative risk assessment
published in The Lancet looked at the global 
burden of disease across 195 countries and found that in the year 2017, 11 million deaths and 255 million disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) were attributable to dietary risk factors.
48 In fact, according to the researchers, 
high intake of sodium accounted for 3 million deaths and 70 million DALYs, low intake of whole grains accounted for 3 million deaths and 82 million DALYs, and low intake of fruits accounted for 2 million deaths and 65 million DALYs.
4910    Introduction    Introduction   11Food for Preventive Health, Disease Treatment 
& Public Health
While diet has the potential to cause disease, 
it is also capable of building, maintaining, and restoring health.
,50,51,52,53 Unprocessed 
whole foods, for example, provide nutrients the body needs to prevent and combat diseases and disorders that respond favorably to nutritional intervention.
54 A systematic 
review  of existing research on U.S. dietary 
patterns published in the the Journal of the 
American Medical Association found evidence 
that nutrient-dense diets reduced patients’ risk of dying from chronic disease. 
55 The 
review, which assessed one randomized trial and 152 observational studies, concluded that diets rich in vegetables, fruits, lean proteins, nuts, legumes, and whole grains decreased mortality rates associated with cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, and some cancers.
56 This decline in patient 
mortality was observed across the studies despite differences in approach and assessment methods.
57
Recent research has also suggested that even relatively small dietary adjustments can help to reverse the increased mortality rates attributable to food-related diseases.
58,59 In 
an August 2021 study published by Nature 
Food, researchers reported that substituting 10 percent of the beef and processed meats in patients’ diets for fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, and select seafood could increase their lifespans by 48 minutes per person per day.
60 Researchers arrived at this estimate 
by scoring foods according to 15 dietary risk factors for chronic disease and translating these scores into an assessment of the net minutes of healthy life gained or lost through consuming them.
61
Reductions to the amount of added sugar in the American diet also show promise as means of improving and equalizing health care outcomes.
62Research  conducted on 
behalf of the American Heart Association and published in August 2021 suggests that achieving the packaged food and beverage sugar content targets set by the US National Salt and Sugar Reduction Initiative  in 2018 
could prevent almost half a million deaths from cardiovascular disease and around 750,000 diabetes cases.
63 These reductions in chronic 
disease would likely translate to a $160 billion reduction in health care costs over a 28.33 year period.
64 Achieving the targets is also 
anticipated to have the greatest impact on the health of individuals with lower income, as well as Black and Hispanic Americans, helping to reduce health disparities.
65
Diet may also provide a solution when disease is present.
66 In fact, food interventions are 
effectively being used to prevent, manage, treat, and co-treat, a variety of disease states (e.g. Alzheimer’s,
67,68,69 arthritis,70,71
autism,72,73,74,75,76 cancer,77,78 cardiovascular 
disease,79,80,81 celiac disease,82 chronic 
kidney disease,83,84 cirrhosis/ascites,85,86,87,88
Crohn’s,89,90,91 depression,92,93 diabetes,94,95
digestive disorders,96,97 eating disorders,98,99

gastroesophageal reflux disease,104,105,106 HIV/
AIDS,107,108 hypertension,109,110 ,111 multiple 
sclerosis,112,113,114,115 osteoporosis,116,117,118,119
overweight/obesity,120,121 and skin 
diseases122,123,124). [Note: Treatment of disease, 
using food, alone or in combination with other treatments, will be discussed in Part IV more extensively.]
Health care systems are increasingly 
being encouraged to use food as medicine interventions, such as medically-tailored meals
125 and food (i.e., fruit and vegetable) prescriptions,126 as methods of achieving 
improved health outcomes in patients with diet-related chronic diseases.
127,128,129,130,131
For example, at NYU Langone’s Perlmutter Cancer Center in New York City, cancer patients are receiving individually-tailored nutritious meals to help them tackle loss of appetite.
132 Addressing this issue is critical 
as malnourishment from not eating can lead to greater complications during cancer treatment.
133
Additionally, related evidence is growing to support the impact of food-based government policies to improve public health. Researchers from a study published in the journal Health 
Affairs found that patients dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid in a medically-tailored meal program had fewer emergency department visits and lower health-related costs.
134 Covering healthy meals under 
Medicare and Medicaid therefore could be an effective way to improve the health of those enrolled. (Approximately 80 million individuals in the United States have health coverage through Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program [CHIP] in 2021 and approximately 61 million individuals have health coverage through Medicare.)
135,136Furthermore, various state governments have begun investing in food-related movements to improve the social and economic conditions that contribute to health.
137 For example, New 
York State passed a bill  in 2019 that requires 
hospitals to provide plant-based meals at no extra cost to patients.
138 Jay Inslee, Governor 
of Washington State, signed an executive 
order in 2013 that requires state agencies provide “healthful food and beverages” in cafeterias, vending machines, catered meetings, and retail establishments.
139 On the 
federal level, the Agriculture Improvement Act (known as the Farm Bill) includes support and funding for produce prescription programs by way of the Gus Schumacher Nutrition Incentive Program.
140
12    Introduction    Introduction   13Synthesizing the Evidence to Drive Change
For change to occur in our food and health 
systems, and for food as medicine to be incorporated in our health care system and policies, diverse stakeholders must be engaged, including farmers, chefs, physicians and physician extenders, nutritionists, policymakers, elected officials, government staffers, community based organizations, public health advocates, academics, insurance companies, food companies, media, and patients.
141 However, meaningful progress 
towards impactful interventions and policies is limited by the accessibility of evidence-
based information about the prevention and treatment of disease using food and or a combination of food and other treatments.
The focus of this report is to synthesize 
existing scholarship on food as medicine into a single, interdisciplinary resource. This report will serve as the basis for a shared understanding among scientists, medical professionals, policymakers, and other key stakeholders of how food can be used in the management and treatment of chronic disease and can lay the foundation for future study of food as a therapeutic.The first section, “Part I: Food as Medicine - A Brief History,” highlights how food as medicine was practiced across ancient cultures, and its rise in popularity in modern society and popular culture. The second section, “Part II: Food as Medicine Challenges,” discusses critical challenges in the food ecosystem that limit the reach and impact of the food as medicine movement. The third section, “Part III: Food as Medicine - Interventions, Programs, Policies and Practices,” describes food as medicine interventions and spotlights successful programs and policies leveraging food as medicine philosophy. Lastly, the fourth section, “Part IV: Food as Medicine - Treating and Managing Disease,” summarizes the evidence of food as medicine to treat and manage specific diseases and conditions. This report concludes with a list of recommendations for readers who currently are or aim to be advocates for and key stakeholders in the food as medicine movement.

Food as Medicine:  
A Brief History
As early as 300 BCE, humans were cultivating 
food crops for medicinal purposes.142 Since 
that time, food as medicine and food as preventive medicine remained an integral component of many Eastern healing practices. Practitioners advised people how to live so that they would not become ill, although it was generally acknowledged that diet was powerless against epidemic diseases.
143,144
Western cultures, however, have slowly broken away from using food as medicine.
145
In the 18th and 19th centuries, scientific investigation and innovation dominated Western understanding of medicine.
146
During that time, American medical education underwent notable advancements.
147 In 1745, 
the first formal course in human anatomy was established at the University of Pennsylvania, and in 1829, the first American textbook on pathology was published.
148,149 These 
innovations, among others, ultimately inspired a shift away from nutrition-based medicine towards allopathic medicine.
150 Allopathic 
medicine is defined  by the National Cancer 
Institute as: “A system in which medical doctors and other healthcare professionals (such as nurses, pharmacists, and therapists) treat symptoms and diseases using drugs, radiation, or surgery. Also called biomedicine, conventional medicine, mainstream medicine, orthodox medicine, and Western medicine.”
151
However, the use of food as medicine is rooted in science and has been adopted and practiced by numerous cultures despite the fact that the history of food as medicine was largely ignored by academics until the 21st century.
152,153,154 Now, largely because of its 
increasing social media presence and online attention,
155,156 academic study of the history 
and use of food as medicine has begun to gain momentum, finding its place in journals, conferences, and programs of study.
157,158,159,160
18   Part I  Food as Medicine:  A Brief History   Part I  Food as Medicine:  A Brief History   19
Food as Medicine in Ancient Cultures
Many ancient cultures shared a holistic belief 
that disease was caused by the improper flow of the body’s vital energies.
161 Because 
ancient healers and physicians lacked much of the knowledge and technologies we use in medical practice today, their treatments were often reliant on food.
162,163
Most treatments used rituals, elixirs, herbs, and dietary practices to eliminate blockages and restore balance to the body,
164 while 
the risks and dangers of emerging, curative medicine were frequently as harmful as the illness itself (e.g., bloodletting, trepanation, tracheostomies).
165,166,167
Traditional Chinese Medicine
The use of food as medicine in China may date back as far as the Neolithic period, when people sacrificed ale and meat to their ancestors in the hope of securing the spirits’ protection from death and disease.
168 By 
the Qin dynasty (221-206 BCE), dieticians had emerged as one of the six categories of Chinese physicians.
169 Around this time, 
Chinese shamans and physicians began to record “Recipes For Nurturing Life” ( Yang 
sheng fang), which, according to Stanford University’s Encyclopedia of Philosophy , 
“consists of eighty-seven recipes, including food, drugs, and beverages, along with several sexual cultivation exercises.”
170,171 Alongside 
the standard information on symptoms, diagnostics, and treatments, Chinese medical textbooks contained botanical field guides that gave extensive information about medicinal herbs.
172 Certain principles of Traditional 
Chinese Medicine are evident in many current views concerning diet and disease among Chinese people today,
173 such as the 
importance of a consistent, balanced diet composed of grains, vegetables, and fruit.
174One of the main ways Chinese physicians used herbs was to balance qi (CHē) . A 
fundamental concept in Chinese medicine, qi refers to a vital life energy that circulates through people and their environment.
175
According to practitioners of Traditional Chinese Medicine, qi flowed according to the 
complementary and opposed dynamics of yin and yang. People’s health depended on having the right balance of yin and yang so 
that their qi would flow properly.
176,177 Among 
the “Recipes for Nurturing Life” were dietary methods for people to achieve the proper circulation of qi in their bodies.
178 Foods were 
categorized as promoting yin or yang and 
prescribed to the sick to reset this balance and eliminate disease. If patients showed symptoms of “greater yang disease,” for example, including trouble breathing, fever, chills, and vomiting, they were prescribed a tea made with cinnamon, ginger, and various flowers, fruits, and spices.
179 The cinnamon 
was said to cure chills, and ginger calmed the vomiting, while peony and licorice reset the yin 
and boosted the body’s defenses against the disease.
180 When looking at this prescription 
through a modern lens, it becomes clear why it was used. Cinnamon has anti-inflammatory properties to treat fever,
181 and studies have 
shown ginger to be effective against nausea.182
In addition, both peony root and licorice have antioxidant properties.
183,184,185
20   Part I  Food as Medicine:  A Brief History   Part I  Food as Medicine:  A Brief History   21In addition to using food to treat individual 
patients, Traditional Chinese Medicine turned food into a tool for improving public health. When an epidemic swept through China during the Song dynasty (960-1279 CE) and had a particularly devastating impact on its poor,
186 Emperor Huizong (1082-1135 CE) 
responded by creating “Peace and Relief Hospitals” in rural provinces.
187 Each hospital 
had a kitchen and a pharmacy and treated patients with easy-to-consume prescriptions created from medicinal foods.
188 The 
success of these treatments prompted many physicians to found private pharmacies,
189
and as the number of pharmacies grew and the techniques they used to create medicine became more precise, food-based prescriptions grew to be among the most accessible and well-regarded forms of treating disease and solving public health crises in premodern China.
190
Traditional Chinese Medicine is still practiced extensively today, and the National Institutes of Health’s National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) keeps information  about the safety of various 
remedies available for people interested in using this method of addressing health problems.
191 Worldwide, an estimated 1.5 
billion people use Chinese herbal medicine today, and the value of the Traditional Chinese Medicine industry is estimated to be about a third of the total pharmaceutical industry in China.
192 Furthermore, according to the 
WHO’s 2019 Global Report on Traditional and Complementary Medicine, 100 member states formally acknowledged that Traditional Chinese Medicine was used by people in their country.
193
The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews  has compiled research on Traditional 
Chinese Medicine treatments for numerous diseases and conditions, and has found evidence that it might be effective in treating angina pectoris,
194 endometriosis,195 high 
cholesterol,196 irritable bowel syndrome,197
menstrual cramps,198 and more. However, 
almost 50 percent of Traditional Chinese Medicine reviews in the Cochrane Database were conducted without the involvement of a Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioner, the inclusion of whom likely would have improved the researchers’ understanding of how practitioners determine individual treatment plans.
199 Additionally, the authors 
noted that the reviews related to Traditional Chinese Medicine “were not up-to-date according to Cochrane criteria, some reviews pooled the results of different herbal medicines and ignored the searching of Chinese databases.”
200
While there have been a plethora of clinical studies of the effectiveness of various Traditional Chinese Medicine practices, there is a lack of good quality evidence with high credibility.
201,202 Since Traditional Chinese 
Medicine is so popular today in China and beyond, effective integration of its therapeutic practices with evidence-based medicine could help patients find the most effective treatment plan for their lives and conditions.
203
Food as Medicine in 
Ancient Greece
The Greek physician Hippocrates (460-
375BCE)204 and the physician and philosopher 
Galen (129-216 CE)205 are often described 
as the forefathers of modern Western medicine.
206,207 There is little known about the 
life of Hippocrates beyond his status as one of the first medical researchers to attribute the body’s health to diet and medicine rather than divinity and the gods.
208,209 There are about 60 
surviving medical texts that bear his name, but scholars think that most of these works were not actually written by him.
210 Hundreds of 
years after Hippocrates came Galen, a Greek-born expatriate living in Rome who Spotlight: Hippocrates and the Quote 
Representing of Food as Medicine
It is important to note that Ancient Greek physicians, including Hippocrates, did not 
confuse food and medicine.211 Rather, food and diet were understood to contribute to a 
person’s health, and the importance of nutritional intervention was well established.212
Hippocrates is also often credited with the following impactful quote: “Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food,” which is perhaps the most well-known quote attributed to the food as medicine movement.
213,214,215 While Hippocrates was a pioneer 
in developing evidence-based medicine (which included studying the effect of diet on health),
216 according to Diana Cárdenas, MD, PhD, associate editor of the journal Clinical 
Nutrition ESPEN and professor in the faculty of medicine at the Universidad El Bosque, Colombia, there is no evidence that Hippocrates made this statement.
217,218
“[Hippocrates’] work was compiled either directly or indirectly through his disciples, so that the existing knowledge on Hippocrates’ medicine consists of more than 60 texts known as The Hippocratic Corpus (Corpus Hippocraticum). This important text in the history of medicine expounds on the theory of diet.”
219,220,221 In these texts, disease is 
attributed to natural causes, physiological imbalances, and poor diet.222
While Dr. Cárdenas believes the statement has had tremendous impact, she argues “the phrase ‘let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food,’ a widespread phrase quoted by today’s scientists, is nowhere to be seen [in the 60 medical texts know as Hippocratic Corpus (Corpus Hippocraticum)]. This literary creation is not only a misquotation but it also leads to an essential misconception: in the Hippocratic medicine, even if food was closely linked to health and disease, the concept of food was not confused with that of medicine.”
223 Dietary intervention was considered one of the most important medical 
interventions that Hippocratic physicians could use to treat disease, but it was separate from medicine and surgical procedures.
224
Nevertheless the quotation has appeared in numerous scholarly publications225 and 
according to Dr. Cárdenas in the quote has been used:
• To explore the association between diet and health• To highlight the medicinal properties of foods• To emphasize the skeptical attitude of doctors towards nutrition• To emphasize the antiquity of the “widely accepted for generations philosophy of 
medicinal power of foods”
• To highlight the lack of nutrition care in hospitals
226
While the quote “Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food,” may not have been directly mentioned in Hippocrates’ 60 medical texts, there is the possibility that it was stated rather than written, nevertheless, the impact and meaning has been far reaching. 22   Part I  Food as Medicine:  A Brief History   Part I  Food as Medicine:  A Brief History   23
served as physician to the Roman emperor 
Marcus Aurelius.227 Galen’s works, which were 
built upon those of Hippocrates, supported physiological experimentation and a thorough understanding of anatomy.
228
Hippocrates considered bodily factors known as “humors” in his treatment of patients.
229
The humors are four fluids—phlegm, blood, yellow bile, and black bile—that, according to Hippocrates, needed to be kept in balance in order to maintain health.
230 For example, 
an excess of black bile was thought to cause cancer.
231 Humoral theory remained popular 
well into the Elizabethan era of England and beyond.
232,233,234,235,236 Shakespeare used 
humoral theory in some of his plays, including The Taming of the Shrew
237 and The Merchant 
of Venice .238 The balance (or imbalance) 
of the four humors was said to influence people’s dispositions and characteristics,
239
and the attitudes of different characters in Shakespeare’s plays were frequently attributed to their humors.
240,241 Only once people began 
to understand bacteria and viruses as major causes of disease did humoral medicine fall out of favor in the West.
242
Dietetics was largely viewed as synonymous with internal medicine in ancient Greek medical practice.
243 It is important to note that 
to many ancient Greek scholars of medicine, the phrase diaita  (roughly translated to 
“dietetics”) refers to food, drink, and physical exercise.
244 In some cases, diaita also 
encompasses bathing and sexual activity.245
In one of the Hippocratic texts, On Diet, dietetics is seen as directly influencing the body’s internal temperature and moisture balance.
246 Certain foods were written about in 
Hippocrates’s body of work as being heating, cooling, drying, or moistening. For example, if a Greek physician determined that a patient needed to “cool down,” he might prescribe a regimen of specific “foodstuffs” and types of exercise to achieve this effect.
247Ancient Greek medicine has left a lasting legacy: physicians and health care professionals still must follow the principles of the Hippocratic Oath
248 and the caduceus (a 
rod with two intertwined snakes that was the symbol of the Greek god Hermes) has become a symbol for modern medicine.
249 English 
speakers still use humoral words like “melancholic” (black bile) and “sanguine” (blood) to describe people of different temperaments and characteristics.

Ayurvedic Medicine in India
Ayurveda is an ancient form of medicine that has been practiced in India for more than 3,000 years.
252 According to the National 
Institutes of Health’s National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) overview  of Ayurvedic medicine: 
The ancient Indian medical system, 
also known as Ayurveda, is based on ancient writings that rely on a ‘natural’ and holistic approach to physical and mental health. Ayurvedic medicine is one of the world’s oldest medical systems and is still practiced today. Ayurvedic treatment combines products that are mainly derived from plants but may also include animal, metal, and mineral, along with diet, exercise, and lifestyle.
253
The NCCIH also describes a few well 
designed studies and systematic research reviews demonstrating the effectiveness of Ayurvedic Medicine for conditions including knee osteoarthritis,
254 rheumatoid arthritis,255,256
type 2 diabetes,257 and ulcerative colitis.258
[See Ayurvedic Medicine - Systematic 
Reviews/Reviews/Meta-analyses (PubMed)and Ayurvedic Medicine - Randomized 
Controlled Trials (PubMed) ]24   Part I  Food as Medicine:  A Brief History   Part I  Food as Medicine:  A Brief History   25
Ayurvedic practitioners use food to impact 
the health of the mind and the body,259 and 
recognize the different effects of various foods.
260 Foods are classified as satvika 
(promoting thought and intelligence), rajsika 
(good for physical labor), or tamasika 
(encouraging laziness).261 Practitioners 
prescribe foods and diets based on their patients’ individual doshas ,
262 occupations,263
and pre-existing medical conditions.264 The 
goal of Ayurvedic dietary practices is to ensure a well-rounded diet that “contains different types of foods in such quantities and proportions that the need of the body is adequately met,” wrote Das Banamali, a writer 
and researcher, in the Journal of Homeopathy & Ayurvedic Medicine.
265 It is important for 
practitioners to remember, however, that body needs vary from person-to-person; there is no one-size-fits-all approach to an Ayurvedic diet.
266,267
In rural India, about 70 percent of the population still relies on Ayurvedic medicine,
268,269 and the NCCIH estimates
that about 240,000 American adults also use Ayurvedic medicine.
270 There is, however, 
some concern that with the popularity of Ayurveda has come a deterioration in the standards of education for its practitioners.
271
In a study looking at knowledge and attitudes towards Ayurvedic medicine use among allopathic resident doctors, researchers found that:
[a]llopathic residents had little knowledge 
about basic concepts of Ayurveda, that is, ‘panchakarma’ and ‘tridosha.’ Majority residents (99 percent) had no opportunity to learn the basics of Ayurveda, but 67 percent residents prescribed Ayurvedic medicines to patients. However, many residents (76 percent) mentioned that cross practice should not be allowed due to lack of knowledge.
272
In 2014, the Government of India established 
the Ministry of Ayush to oversee the Ayurvedic practice has roots in two ancient Hindu schools of thought: Vaisheshika , 
a school of philosophy, and Nyaya, a school of logic.
283Vaisheshika  describes 
the observations that must be made about a patient’s condition, and Nyaya teaches 
that practitioners of medicine should have extensive knowledge of a disease before treating a patient.
284 The healing practices 
taught by these Hindu schools of thought were later compiled into two texts, the Charaka Samhita and the Sushruta Samhita ,
285 which 
are most frequently referred to by historians when studying Ayurvedic theory.
286
Ayurvedic practitioners attribute the body’s basic physiological functions to three doshas
or energies (sometimes spelled dosa
287): Vata, 
Pitta, and Kapha .288 These doshas  regulate 
different aspects of the human body:
Vata dosha maintains the cellular transport, 
electrolyte balance, elimination of waste products and its effect is increased by dryness. Pitta dosha regulates body temperature, optic nerve coordination and hunger and thirst management. Heat conditions of the body aggravate Pitta. Kapha dosha  is increased due to sweet 
and fatty food and it provides lubrication to the joints for proper functioning.
289
Practitioners believe that disequilibrium of the 
doshas  leads to poor health and disease.290 In 
addition to the doshas , Ayurvedic practitioners 
consider the body’s seven dhatus, or tissues—Rasa (tissue fluids), Meda (fat and connective tissue), Rakta (blood), Asthi (bones), Majja(marrow), Mamsa (muscle) and Shukra(semen)—and the three malas, or wastes—
Purisha  (feces), Mutra (urine) and Sweda
(sweat).
291 These three constituents ( dosha , 
dhatu, and mala) are said to be largely formed by nutrition and diet.
292 Finally, each patient 
falls into a different genetically-determined prakriti category, which helps the Ayurvedic practitioner determine a patient’s susceptibility to particular diseases and conditions.
29326   Part I  Food as Medicine:  A Brief History   Part I  Food as Medicine:  A Brief History   27development of traditional medical practices 
in India, including Ayurveda.273 Within this 
Ministry is the National Institute of Ayurveda, committed to improving the quality of Ayurveda education and training.
274
Research suggests that Ayurveda might have the potential to treat numerous chronic illnesses, including cancer, diabetes, and asthma.
275,276,277 However, the NCCIH’s in-
depth overview  on Ayurvedic medicine, 
concluded the following with regards to its effectiveness: “A few studies suggest that Ayurvedic preparations may reduce pain and increase function in people with osteoarthritis and help manage symptoms in people with type 2 diabetes, but most of these trials are small or not well-designed. There is little scientific evidence on Ayurveda’s value for other health issues.”
278 Researchers have 
noted that in order to better serve the needs of patients, modern healthcare providers and Ayurvedic practitioners must find ways to integrate their treatment models and clinical drug trials.
279,280,281 Arvind Chopra, MD, a 
physician at the Arthritis Research and Care Foundation Center for Rheumatic Diseases, has been an advocate  for integrating 
Ayurvedic treatment and Western medicine. According to Dr. Chopra: We need to interpret logic of Ayurveda 
when, adopting modern science tools in drug development and validation and much research is required. Validation of Ayurvedic medicines using the latter approach may lead to an evidence based Ayurveda – Modern Medicine interface. Also, in pursuit of finding better treatment solutions, we ought to step beyond the realm of only drugs and attempt validation of comprehensive specific treatment package as per classical Ayurveda. Finally, validation of a combined (Ayurveda and modern medicine) therapeutic approach with superior efficacy and safety is likely to be a major leap in overcoming some of the current frustrations to treat difficult disorders like arthritis using only modern medicines.

lead much more sedentary lives.294 American 
settlers have pushed the native people off 
their lands, leaving them with little choice but to adopt a Westernized way of life, including higher-fat diets and less physical labor.
295
According to social science writer Malcolm Gladwell, writing for The New Yorker in 1998, 
the high rates of diet-related disease among the Pima have led to a sense of resignation, “that nothing can be done, that the way things are is the way things have to be.”
296
Food as medicine principles were also practiced by the native peoples of the region now known as Latin America. For example, many of the ancient Mesoamerican people of Mexico used chile peppers from the genus Capsicum  for a variety of purposes, including 
as medicine.
297 The Maya peoples in particular 
used the fruits, leaves, seeds, and even roots of the Capiscum to treat numerous ailments, including respiratory problems, gastrointestinal issues, earaches, and sores.
298 Researchers 
have also found Capsicum  to have 
antimicrobial properties that can be used to fight off bacterial diseases such as tetanus.
299
Medicinal plants, used extensively by many of these cultures, are still relied upon by many communities in Latin America and demonstrate potential to be used in modern medicinal treatments.
300,301 One such example is yac”n, 
a perennial flower with tuberous roots, traditionally grown in the Andes.
302 Nearly all of 
the plant is used in both the culinary traditions of the region and the medicinal practice – the plant is regarded by many as a functional food.
303 It is reported to prevent fatigue and 
cramps, relieve constipation, lower high blood pressure, and more.
304
Animal products and foods have also had a long history of use in traditional medicine practices of Latin America; at least 584 animal species have been recorded as used in traditional medicine.
305 These species Food as Medicine in the New 
World (Western Hemisphere)
Various Native American tribes have also 
practiced food as medicine from ancient times until today.
306,307 Medicinal food and 
beverage plants were gathered and utilized by indigenous populations of eastern Canada to treat numerous physical ailments,
308 including 
gastrointestinal issues and musculoskeletal disorders.
309 Salal, a shrub native to the Pacific 
Northwest, is used by Native American people near the Puget Sound to treat heartburn, fever, sinus inflammation, and more.
310,311 ,312 Many of 
the medicinal plants used by Native American, Native Hawaiian, and Alaska Native tribes have also been documented by the National Library of Medicine, such as yucca, purple coneflower, and dandelion.
313
A number of traditional Native diets are largely plant-based and have been found to help fight the chronic diet-related diseases that are prevalent in indigenous communities today, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes.
314
Native American diets consisted of corn, bean, squash, root crops, native berries, wild rice, fruits, nuts, seeds, and game—diets that are presently considered balanced and composed of whole foods.
315,316
Of note, however, the Westernization of many Native American diets and lifestyles has been associated with the increase in diet-related diseases that are prevalent among these populations.
317,318 Perhaps the most striking 
example of this is among the Pima people of central Arizona, who have historically had one of the highest rates of obesity and type 2 diabetes in the world.
319,320,321,322 During 
the twentieth century, the Pima lifestyle changed from primarily hunting and gathering nutrient-dense foods to subsisting on high-fat processed foods provided by the United States government.
323 Furthermore, the Pima of 
Arizona used to work the land but today 30   Part I  Food as Medicine:  A Brief History   Part I  Food as Medicine:  A Brief History   31range from reptiles to shellfish, insects to wild 
birds.324 According to researchers Rômulo 
Alves and Humberto Alves writing  in the 
Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine :
Hard parts, such as teeth, nails, shells, 
rattles from snakes, fish scales, bone and cartilage generally are sun-dried, grated and crushed to powder, being then administered as tea or taken during meals, while fat, body secretion and oil are either ingested or used as an ointment.
325
The significance of medicinal plants in 
Latin America has led to a clear trend within the West of people seeking “exotic” remedies.
326 Traditional foods, such as 
açai and Peruvian root maca, are regularly marketed as “superfoods” that come from a primitive “nutritional utopia,” write researchers 
Jessica Loyer and Christine Knight in Food, 
Culture & Society .
327 This “superfood” label 
is problematic for a variety of reasons (superfoods are discussed in further detail in Part II),
328 not the least of which due to the 
“commodity racism” they promote. Loyer and Knight write that these primitive superfoods “reinforc[e] neocolonial social relations by temporally distancing ‘primitive’ producers from modern Western consumers.”
329
An example of this can be found in quinoa, a grain native to the Andean region of South America.
330 The crop has been used by the 
native peoples of the Andes as both food and medicine for thousands of years, but since the late nineties it has been used to create various nutraceuticals and functional food products sold across the globe.
331 The marketing of 
quinoa often relies on its history and status as an “ancient grain,” but companies selling quinoa often obfuscate the “social, economic, and ecological complexities surrounding the quinoa industries in Peru and Bolivia.”
332Additional Cultures Practicing 
Food as Medicine
Similar to China and India, some parts of 
the Mediterranean, as well as many Islamic countries, still practice a form of ancient medicine known as Arab-Islamic herbal medicine or Traditional Arabic and Islamic Medicine, which is descended from Greco-Arab and Islamic medical practices.
333 Having 
inspired early European medical education,334
these practices are used today to treat diseases such as cancer,
335 diabetes,336 and 
liver disease.337,338 While there is very little 
information reported on early Greco-Arab and Islamic medicine, there are a few sources which demonstrate the use of diet as the first line of defense against disease; only if food did not work would a physician turn to drugs.
339
According to Dr. Bashar Saad, professor of cell biology and immunology at the Arab American University in Jenin, Palestine, the modern use of Arab-Islamic medicine still relies on the use of medicinal plants and herbal remedies, many of which have been used in the development of modern pharmaceuticals.
340
The Yoruba people of western Africa also have a history of traditional herbal medicine that has left an impact on their medicinal practices today.
341 The majority of rural Nigerians, for 
example, rely on traditional healers for their health care needs due to a lack of Western-trained healthcare professionals in the country.
342 Yorubic medicine uses a variety of 
medicinal plants and herbs native to western Africa, and herbalists are considered among the specialists in the traditional medicine discipline.
343,344 Many of these herbs have 
been used to develop modern medicinal treatments for disease.

32   Part I  Food as Medicine:  A Brief History   Part I  Food as Medicine:  A Brief History   33Spotlight: Garlic Throughout History and 
Cultures
Garlic has been used for its medicinal properties by numerous cultures throughout 
history.346 Native to Central Asia, it is an integral component of Traditional Chinese 
Medicine,347 Ayurveda348 and other traditional forms of medicine around the globe. The 
ancient people of Sumer used garlic for its healing attributes,349 while ancient Egyptians 
used it to stimulate laborers and slaves.350 In ancient India, it was used to cure a variety 
of ailments, including hemorrhoids, cough, skin diseases and general weakness.351 
Richard S. Rivlin, MD, writing in the Journal of Nutriton ’s “Recent Advances on the 
Nutritional Benefits Accompanying the Use of Garlic as a Supplement,” said of garlic that “cultures that never came into contact with one another came to many of the same conclusions about the role of garlic in the treatment of disease.”
352 
Among the earliest recorded uses of garlic as medicine is in the ancient Egyptian Codex Ebers, a medical papyrus from 1550 BCE.
353 The Egyptians were accomplished healers 
and were familiar with many medicinal plants, but garlic was the one used most often.354 
In the Codex Ebers, it is mentioned as a therapeutic remedy for headaches, bites, and tumors.
355 Artistic renderings of garlic have been found in ancient Egyptian tombs that 
date as far back as 3700 BCE, indicating the plant’s importance in Egyptian culture.356 
From Egypt, garlic as a medicinal food made its way to ancient Greece, Rome, Israel and beyond.
357
What properties does garlic have that makes it so popular as a remedy? Michael Netzel, PhD, a senior research fellow in the Centre for Nutrition and Food Sciences at the University of Queensland, wrote of it in a 2020 article from the peer-reviewed journal Foods: 
A broad range of biological functions and properties are attributed to garlic, including antioxidant capacity, anti-inflammatory activity, antimicrobial activity, modulation of the immune system, cardiovascular protection, anticancer activity, hepatoprotective activity, protection of the digestive system, anti-diabetic activity, anti-obesity activity as well as neuro- and renal-protection.
358 
However, Netzel notes that few of the reported features of garlic have been fully studied in humans, and more research is needed to understand its potential as a nutraceutical or functional food.
359
Researchers have found that garlic has many disease-fighting components in humans.
360,361,362 Its organosulfur compounds, such as allicin (the compound that 
cause garlic’s and onion’s unique pungent aroma363), may provide an effective 
antiviral function.364,365 And garlic extracts have also been found to have antioxidant 
properties,366,367 although the level of effectiveness varies based on the region where the 
plant is grown.368,369 Studies have also shown that garlic has antimicrobial effects against bacteria, fungi, and parasites.
370,371,372,373 These antimicrobial properties led to the use of garlic as a mild 
antibiotic in the mid-nineteenth century, and as an antiseptic during World Wars I and II.
374 Finally, it has been used as a treatment for various bacterial diseases throughout 
history, including typhus, cholera, diphtheria, and tuberculosis.375
Consumption of garlic and other allium vegetables (e.g., onions, leeks, chives) have been linked to decreased risk of stomach and colon cancer.
376 The organosulfur 
compounds, in addition to potentially being antiviral,377,378 are known to give it anti-tumor 
properties; some of these compounds can suppress tumor development and slow down the growth of tumors.
379
Incorporating garlic into everyday foods is incredibly easy, as it can be added to nearly any savory dish to add aroma and flavor. For the best effects, crush or cut garlic before cooking, which releases the allicin.
380 Furthermore, overcooking garlic can destroy the 
enzyme that activates its disease-fighting compounds, so garlic should always be added toward the end of the cooking process.
381
34   Part I  Food as Medicine:  A Brief History   Part I  Food as Medicine:  A Brief History   35Spotlight: Mushrooms as Medicine, from 
Ancient Times to Present Day
Mushrooms have been used as medicine for millennia, and their use is seeing renewed 
interest in recent years.382,383 However, “[u]sing these medicines require[s] both a 
working knowledge of toxic versus safe mushrooms and the ability to physiologically respond to the chemicals they produce,” write researchers Paul Stamets, DSc and Heather Zwickey, PhD in the scientific journal Integrative Medicine .
384 Some mushrooms 
can heal, some can kill, and some can just be dinner; this diverse range of potential applications of mushrooms can make them particularly fascinating to study.
385
Mushrooms are a good low-fat source of protein, dietary fiber, vitamin C, and B vitamins.
386 They also supply a good source of selenium,387 which is needed for proper 
functioning of the thyroid gland.388 In addition, research suggests that selenium may 
reduce the risk of lung, liver and prostate cancers.389
An example of a mushroom with numerous functional nutritional properties is the shiitake mushroom, or Lentinus edodes , which is a strong source of protein, fiber, B 
vitamins, and more.
390 Shiitakes also contain an important compound called lentinan, 
which has been shown to have antitumor and antimicrobial properties.391
Many of the bioactive compounds found in certain edible mushrooms have been associated with lowered risks for anxiety and depression among adults.
392,393 One 
mushroom in particular, Hericium erinaceus  (known colloquially as lion’s mane), has 
been associated with improved sleep quality and overall mood.394,395
The terms used in the marketing of mushrooms, however, are not always accurate.396 
“Wild mushrooms,” for example, is an unregulated phrase, so products marketed as containing “wild mushrooms” do not always contain the wild mushrooms, such as porcinis and truffles that consumers may expect.
397 A 2021 study of food products using 
the label “wild mushrooms” found that cultivated mushrooms, such as shiitake and portobello, are frequently passed off as “wild.”
398 Furthermore, a few food products were 
found to contain mushrooms that were potentially toxic.399
Mushrooms are also known for the psychedelic properties of certain species, a use that is receiving renewed interest.
400 The state of Oregon was the first to legalize the 
use of psilocybin-containing mushrooms (colloquially known as “magic mushrooms”) for therapeutic purposes in 2020.
401 This move was the culmination of mounting media 
attention paid to psilocybin and “magic mushrooms,” including from notable food writer Michael Pollan.
402,403 From a historical perspective, decriminalizing (and even legalizing) 
psilocybin is unsurprising to many, as it has been used by cultures around the world since ancient times to heal.
404
Studies have shown that psychedelic therapies using psilocybin might have potential to treat psychiatric distress and addiction.
405 The Johns Hopkins Center for Psychedelic 
and Consciousness Research at Johns Hopkins University has done extensive research into the medicinal potential of psilocybin.
406,407 Researchers from this center have found 
psilocybin to be an effective tool in treating major depressive disorder,408 alcohol use 
disorder,409 and anxiety in cancer patients.410 Furthermore, it has been found to facilitate 
smoking cessation.411 It should be noted that in these studies, psilocybin was used 
as a part of a structured therapy regimen, including preparation and monitoring by a healthcare professional.

An Anthropological and Historical Lens into 
Food as Medicine
In a Journal of the History of Medicine and 
Allied Sciences special issue , historians 
and researchers Juliana Adelman, PhD and Lisa Haushofer, MD, PhD explored food as medicine in relation to cultural norms and science.
413 The connection between food 
and medicine can often be categorized in one of two ways.
414 One approach is based 
on how food and medicine developed into distinct cultural practices, with fluid boundaries between the two, as is evident in Chinese, Ancient Greek, and Ayurvedic medicine.
415,416,417 The other focuses on 
recent scientific advances and how they have increased awareness of the medicinal potential of various foods.
418 Adelman and 
Haushofer write:
Nancy Chen’s Food, Medicine, and the 
Quest for Good Health is a good example 
of the first way. Chen combined a historical 
and anthropological perspective on the development of eating and medicating as distinct cultural practices. While the book emphasizes the ways in which food and dietary prescriptions are shaped by culture, it also at times upholds a false dichotomy of science and culture. Science and medicine are seen as impacts on the cultural practices of eating, but the development of nutritional knowledge and scientifically informed dietary prescriptions are of course inseparable from particular or historically specific cultural forces. Through a historical survey of dietetic ideas in Ancient Greek, Chinese and Ayurvedic medicine, Chen argues that the boundary between science and medicine used to be much less blurred than it is at present. She adds that “[w]e may have something to learn from cultures that blur the boundaries between these categories.”An example of the second way is the work of anthropologist and ethnopharmacologist Nina Etkin. In her book Edible Medicines, she states that “until the recent and rapidly escalating interest in functional foods and supplements..., foods were regarded as virtually chemically inert, thus of no salience to disease processes.” These two approaches to food as medicine are not mutually exclusive, of course; in fact, many accounts combine nostalgia for the past with enthusiasm for current nutritional science. The continued appearance of the famous misquotation falsely attributed to Hippocrates, “Let thy food be thy medicine, let thy medicine be thy food,” in current works on medicinal foods… illustrates the desire to view recent nutritional science as a confirmation of past wisdom, and past dietetic practices as intuitive anticipations of modern knowledge.
419
One suggested reason for the dichotomy between food and medicine is power dynamics, the intentional separation of medicine from food and agriculture in order to fit notions of the superiority of “civilized” as opposed to non-civilized intelligence.
420
Historians analyze food and medicine by exploring the balance of power between the two—the “professional” versus “layperson,” “theoretical” versus “tacit” knowledge, and “experimental” versus “experiential” knowledge.

Food as Medicine in Modern Society
The HIV/AIDS Pandemic and 
the Rise of Medically-Tailored Meal Programs
Additional interest in and advancement of 
food’s impact on disease occurred during the HIV/AIDS pandemic of the 1980s and 1990s, which led to the emergence of numerous nonprofit organizations that used food to help people living with HIV/AIDS, including Project Open Hand in San Francisco (founded in 1985),
422 God’s Love We Deliver in New York 
City (founded in 1986),423 and Community 
Servings in Boston (founded in 1990).424
These organizations were among the first to provide medically tailored meals to individuals managing disease and have yielded positive results with improved HIV health.
425
In 1990, the United States Congress passed the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency (CARE) Act, creating the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program.
426 This 
program funds grants to state and local governments as well as community-based organizations to provide services (including medically-tailored meals) to people managing HIV or AIDS.
427 This program has been 
described as a “model” of food and nutrition services for people living with chronic illness
428 that policymakers and healthcare 
professionals can look to when designing and implementing nutrition-focused health care intervention plans.
429
Advancing Food as Medicine from 
a Policy and Practice Perspective
In the 1980s, physicians and researchers 
began paying more attention to the relationship between nutrition and physical health. Among these healthcare professionals is Dean Ornish, MD, who helped popularize the idea that you can treat and even reverse disease—particularly cardiovascular disease—by eating a diet rich in whole foods, among other lifestyle changes.
430,431 He founded the 
Preventive Medicine Research Institute in 1984 with the mission of researching how lifestyle medicine, including diet, can reverse, treat and prevent chronic diseases,
432 and 
since the 1990s has published numerous articles in medical journals.
433,434,435,436 The 
Preventive Medicine Research Institute has performed numerous trials and studies on the effect different food programs can have in managing diet-related diseases, including heart disease
437,438 and prostate cancer439
among others. Currently, the Preventive Medicine Research Institute is conducting a trial to determine the effect of lifestyle changes (including diet) on the progression of Alzheimer’s disease.
440
In 1995, another notable physician, Caldwell Esselstyn, MD, published a benchmark, longitudinal nutritional study in the Journal 
of Family Practice demonstrating that a nutritious, low-fat diet could halt and even reverse coronary artery disease in severely ill patients.
441 Throughout Esselstyn’s career, 
he published numerous studies on the impact of plant-based nutrition on diet-related chronic diseases such as coronary artery disease,
442,443,444 hypertension,445 diabetes,446
and retinopathy.447 His work has influenced 
some notable politicians, including former President Bill Clinton
448,449 and New York City 
Mayor Eric Adams.450

functional medicine movement and is one of the more prominent social media influencers to post about food as medicine. He has published numerous bestselling books about nutrition
451
and hosted a PBS special in 2018 about nutrition and health.
452 However, his work 
is not without controversy; he sells dietary supplements to accompany a 10-day “detox” diet,
453 despite there being little evidence that 
detox diets work.454 He also has received 
criticism for his cooperation with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in writing a book about the debunked link between vaccines and autism.
455
The increasing support of food as medicine among these notable figures has given the movement traction among even some of the oldest  nutrition organizations, including the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AND) . 
The AND describes food as medicine as “a philosophy where food and nutrition aids individuals through interventions that support health and wellness.”

Distinct Dietary Patterns in the 
Blue Zones of Health
One of the most fascinating studies of the 
connection between food and its impact on health was performed in 2000 by Giovanni Pes, MD, PhD and Michel Poulain, PhD and published in 2004 in the journal Experimental 
Gerontology . The study identified Sardinia 
as the region of the world with the highest concentration of male centenarians.
457 In 
2000, prior to beginning the study, National Geographic Fellow and author Dan Buettner launched a program with the goal of identifying the world’s longest-lived people and their common attributes.
458 Pes, Poulain, and 
Buettner developed the Blue Zone certification in order to mark regions of the world where a higher than average number of people live longer than others.

Dr. Katz is a physician who has worked to 
advance the principles of food’s impact on the prevention and treatment of disease. His experience includes work with various preventive and lifestyle medicine groups,
461
and he founded the Yale-Griffin Prevention Research Center,
462 the True Health 
Initiative,463 and DietID.464 He has more 
than 200 peer-reviewed publications about nutrition,
465 and in 2020 co-authored a book 
with notable food journalist Mark Bittman, How to Eat: All Your Food and Diet Questions Answered .
466
Dr. Mozaffarian is a cardiologist, dean and Jean Mayer Professor at the Tufts Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy, and professor of medicine at Tufts Medical School. He is the Principal Investigator of Food-PRICE, a group of American researchers who investigate how to improve the diets of Americans and combat diet-related diseases such as heart disease, obesity, and diabetes.
467 He has published extensively 
about the connections between nutrition and health, including about the burden that diet-related disease places on the modern health care system.
468
Congressman McGovern, a long-time hunger and agriculture advocate, launched the bipartisan Food as Medicine Working Group within the House Hunger Caucus in 2018. The group focuses on the impact hunger has on health and health care costs, as well as the importance of creating agricultural and nutrition policies guided by evidence-based health research that demonstrates access to affordable and nutritious foods like fresh produce leads to healthier communities.

42   Part I  Food as Medicine:  A Brief History   Part I  Food as Medicine:  A Brief History   43There are five Blue Zones identified around 
the world where people live significantly longer than people in other parts of the world.
471 Okinawa, Japan; Sardinia, Italy; 
Nicoya, Costa Rica; Ikaria, Greece; and Loma Linda, California are home to some of the longest living people in the world.
472
Longevity has traditionally been regarded as a marker of overall health, and Pes, Poulain, and Buettner’s work illustrates how lifestyle choices and cultural practices factor into leading a long and healthy life.
473
Pes, Poulain, and Buettner studied these zones to see what habits and lifestyle choices overlapped among such physically distant locations. Along with important choices such as exercise, quality time with friends and family, and having a sense of purpose, one of the greatest overlaps they found was diet.
474
They found that individuals living in Blue Zones ate primarily a plant-based diet heavy in beans and lentils and light in meats and dairy (just five 3-4 ounce servings of meat per month).
475
In total, nine common lifestyle habits, including dietary patterns, were identified among people living in the Blue Zones. According to their research, people that live the longest have a diet composed mostly of plants.
476 Leafy 
greens like spinach and kale, seasonal fruits and vegetables, and beans are the most common foods eaten by people in the Blue Zones.
477 And other foods consumed by 
these same people have also been identified as effective in treating specific diseases. For example, olive oil consumption, which is prominent among middle-aged people in Ikaria, has been shown to increase good cholesterol and lower bad cholesterol.
478
People with high levels of High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL) or good cholesterol have been shown to be at lower risk for heart disease and stroke.
479 Additionally, 
egg consumption, which was found to be low among all people living in the five Blue Zones, has been linked to higher rates of prostate cancer for men and aggravated kidney problems for women.
480 The research 
demonstrates the strong impact food has on overall health, and the link between physical health with quality of life. 
The China Study: Connecting Diet 
& Chronic Disease
In their groundbreaking 2005 book, The 
China Study: The Most Comprehensive 
Study of Nutrition Ever Conducted, T. Colin 
Campbell, PhD, a long-time Cornell University researcher, and his son, Thomas M. Campbell II, MD, offer some of the most comprehensive research connecting diet and chronic disease in China.
481
The Campbells found that genes on their own do not always determine diseases; but rather, nutrition plays a key role in which genes are actually expressed.
482 They also found that the 
same nutrition that prevents disease in early stages can be used to halt or reverse disease later on in life, and that nutrition that benefits one chronic disease tends to address a variety of disease states.
483 Their research even 
demonstrated that nutrition can help control the adverse effects of noxious chemicals.
484
The Campbells also noted that nutrition is a matter of the combined activities of food substances and not the result of individual parts—in other words, vitamin supplements, either in pill form or added to food, are not an adequate replacement for nutritious whole foods.
485 For this reason nutrients will act 
differently from medicine, which tends to have quicker and more obvious “wins” when it comes to health.

44   Part I  Food as Medicine:  A Brief History   Part I  Food as Medicine:  A Brief History   45Spotlight: Interview with T � Colin Campbell by 
Charles Platkin, PhD, JD, MPH (2012)487  
T.Colin Campbell is a retired professor of nutritional biochemistry at Cornell University 
who started his career doing research on how to make animals grow faster. His goal was to promote better health by advocating the consumption of more meat, milk and eggs. Then, more than 40 years ago, while he was a young researcher working on a project to help stamp out malnutrition in the Philippines, he came to a turning point that shifted the direction of his life’s work. Now he’s on a mission to share his compelling research on nutrition and diet with the world. He co-wrote a book called The China Study, (BenBella Books, 2005), based on his years of research showing the connection between nutrition and heart disease, diabetes and cancer. The study was the culmination of a 20-year partnership among Cornell University, Oxford University and the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine.
Here are a few answers to the Diet Detective’s questions from the man whose research 
could be responsible for saving our lives by changing our diet.
Charles Platkin: Do we really need to be so worried about exactly what we’re eating? 
Have we blown our “unhealthy” eating habits out of proportion?
Dr. T. Colin Campbell: Yes, and no. We obsess about details (which nutrients, which 
supplements, which specific ailments and diseases are candidates for therapy) but do not pay enough attention to the big picture (whole foods versus processed foods, plant versus animal source foods). Understanding the big picture has the most to offer – by far.
Charles Platkin: Could you tell us briefly about the genesis of The China Study?Dr. T. Colin Campbell: In 1981, the Chinese government announced the results of a 
massive nationwide survey of cancer mortality for 2,400 counties, which showed that cancer was far more common in some areas than in others. Geographic localization was far more intense than in the U.S. because the vast majority of people in China resided in the same place all their lives and consumed locally produced food, at least in rural parts of the country. Americans move around and consume food from places far and wide, making it virtually impossible to do such a study.
Also, dietary lifestyle characteristics of people in rural China were substantially different 
from people in Western societies. These conditions presented an unparalleled and unique opportunity to compare diet, lifestyle and disease mortality rates with Western societies. It also allowed us to compare our results with our extensive and provocative laboratory animal findings obtained during the previous 15 years. I especially wanted to record as many different kinds of diet and lifestyle factors as possible in order to get information on “big picture” questions that seemed to be so contentious in the scientific and public communities.Charles Platkin: In your book you state that, “Among the many associations that are relevant to diet and disease, so many pointed to the same finding: People who ate the most animal-based foods got the most chronic disease. Even relatively small intakes of animal-based food were associated with adverse effects. People who ate the most plant-based foods were the healthiest and tended to avoid chronic disease.” There are some who disagree with this nutritional philosophy.
Dr. T. Colin Campbell: I don’t like to respond to the assertion that people make decisions 
on the basis of “philosophy,” which suggests that people are motivated by personalized agendas in making their decisions. Although I know this to be true for most people, this is not what motivated me. I simply did the research with my many students and colleagues and produced experimental findings that were peer-reviewed and published in the very best scientific journals. I then made my conclusions on the basis of actual empirical data. There was no philosophy involved. If I had a personal bias or philosophy in drawing my conclusions, it would have been exactly the opposite of these conclusions, given my many years on the farm milking cows.
My observation that “even relatively small intakes of animal-based food were associated 
with adverse effects” comes from the data showing that there is a high statistical significance between blood total cholesterol and aggregate chronic disease rates (i.e., “Western” diseases). This is especially interesting because dietary animal-based protein in this survey ranged only from 0 percent to 10 percent of total protein. Moreover, to observe such statistical significance within this very low range of animal-based protein and within such a low range of blood cholesterol is striking, especially when the blood cholesterol was so highly correlated with animal-source foods.
Charles Platkin: Are you suggesting that we all become vegetarians or vegans??Dr. T. Colin Campbell: I have never suggested that we should all be vegetarians, 
because about 90 percent of vegetarians are still consuming food (i.e., dairy, eggs) with nutrient compositions that actually account for the adverse health effects of animal-based foods. Although consuming foods that trend in the direction of better health, vegetarians do not do what they could do. This suggests that vegans should do better, but they, too, compromise their potential benefits because they consume food that is highly processed. My recommendation is to consume a whole-food, plant-based diet without supplementing with added fat, salt, sugar and processed foods. 
Whether people should eat this way is, of course, their choice. Besides, we know that 
a few people (5 percent) can deviate from this practice and still enjoy good health until advanced ages. But this may be analogous to the small number of smokers who live to their 90s and believe that it was their smoking that got them there. If we want to maximize our health, I believe that it would be prudent to go the whole way to an all-plant-based diet and allow ourselves the opportunity to discover some hidden and delicious tastes that are masked because of our addictions to high fat, salt and sugar. Who can calculate the 1 in 20 chance that they might escape the hazards of eating the wrong food? The real question is whether 100 percent plant-based diets are healthier than, say, 90 to 95 percent plant-based diets. This will undoubtedly depend on the differing responses of each individual, although I know of no scientifically valid 46   Part I  Food as Medicine:  A Brief History   Part I  Food as Medicine:  A Brief History   47data showing that people consuming a plant-based diet suffer more and die earlier. 
Indeed, the findings are clearly to the contrary.
Charles Platkin: You also claim that your research showed that the protein casein, which 
makes up 87 percent of cow’s milk protein, promoted all stages of the cancer process. Are you saying that animal protein promotes cancer?
Dr. T. Colin Campbell: In our experimental animal studies, casein as an animal protein 
promotes cancer, in spades. Of all the experimental research my laboratory did, this may be the most convincing. In fact, our findings, done in so many ways, show that casein is the most relevant chemical carcinogen ever discovered. I have presented this information in seminars to virtually all the relevant agencies and research groups who do these kinds of studies, and have published the results in the very best peer-reviewed scientific journals. These findings also are consistent with similar promoting effects of casein on the development of experimental atherogenesis (the lesion leading to heart disease) and rising blood cholesterol levels, among other toxic events.
Charles Platkin: What is the healthiest diet to prevent disease and live our best life?Dr. T. Colin Campbell: The closer we get to a whole foods plant-based diet with minimal 
or no use of added oil, sugar, salt or processed foods, the healthier we will be. On interpreting the scientific evidence, I mostly rely on statistical odds and biological plausibility, which overwhelmingly point in the direction of a plant-based diet. But I become substantially convinced when I see the clinical evidence achieved by my physician colleagues.
Charles Platkin: What about all the white rice the Chinese eat? W e’ve been taught that 
rice should always be brown – that is, 100 percent whole grain?Dr. T. Colin Campbell: Yes, white rice is not the most desirable. It likely would be better 
for the Chinese to eat whole-grain rice.
Charles Platkin: You say that the real science about “food and nutrition has been 
buried beneath a clutter of irrelevant or even harmful information.” Can you please explain more specifically what you mean, and why this has occurred? What’ s wrong 
with nutrition research today? Is it tainted by corporate research dollars and National Institutes of Health mandates? Can we trust what we read in the media?
Dr. T. Colin Campbell: This is a very big, important and complex story. We do the wrong 
thing in nutrition research, not just because we misunderstand nutrition but even more because we misunderstand what the words “health” and “medicine” mean.If I were to put my finger on one explanation of the extraordinary confusion in nutrition research, I would say that it is the way that nutrition is defined. Nutrition should not, for example, be defined as the biological effects of single, isolated nutrients but as the collective, highly integrated effects of all active substances in plant-source foods. The practice of medicine is the antithesis of nutrition. It relies on the biological effects of individual chemicals (e.g., drugs or nutrient supplements) acting independently and, to make matters much worse, on chemicals not in their natural form but in a synthetic form. 
Aside from this scientific argument, there also are highly socio-historical, economic and 
political factors wherein special interests from the food and drug industries exert their enormous power to influence science agencies, regulatory authorities, politicians and the media in order to sway public opinion in favor of their products and profits. I spent about 20 successive years almost continuously involved in some aspect of food and health policy development and witnessed first hand a devastating ef fect of corporate 
interests on public nutrition information. Our system is about creating wealth for the few at the expense of health for the many – and using public taxpayer dollars to do this dirty work! The media merely carry the message of the food and health cartels and mostly know not what they are doing. Trust what you read in the media at your own peril.
Charles Platkin: Do we really need to be buying organic foods? If so, why? What’ s the 
compelling argument for or against?Dr. T. Colin Campbell: I prefer using organic food but must confess that convincing and 
direct scientific evidence for its health benefits is lacking, although there is certainly some reasonable indirect evidence to support health benefits from these foods.
Charles Platkin: If we don’t eat well, should we be taking a multivitamin 
and/or supplements?
Dr. T. Colin Campbell: No. There now is ample evidence that (except perhaps for B12 
and maybe vitamin D) taking vitamin supplements is, at a minimum, a waste of money and at worst, may actually cause harm.
Charles Platkin: What’s your favorite breakfast?Dr. T. Colin Campbell: A bowl of either cold or hot cereal (whole grain) with fresh or 
frozen fruit, various dried fruits (raisins, figs) and a sprinkle of nuts. A breakfast of whole-
grain pancakes with a large dollop of fruit puree, maybe some maple syrup, with no added oil to the pancake mix, also is delicious. My wife does it exactly right.
Charles Platkin: What’s your favorite “junk food”?Dr. T. Colin Campbell: When my wife is not looking, a piece of strongly flavored cheese. 
But it has to be someplace else because it is not to be found in our house.48   Part I  Food as Medicine:  A Brief History   Part I  Food as Medicine:  A Brief History   49Food as Medicine in Popular Culture
Documentaries Bring Food as 
Medicine into Public Discourse
One of the earliest documentaries chronicling 
the relationship between food and health was the 2004 Super Size Me . Filmmaker Morgan 
Spurlock ate exclusively McDonald’s fast food for thirty straight days, and the documentary follows the changes to his physical and mental health that occur as a result of this drastic shift.
488 Shortly after the film was released, 
McDonald’s discontinued the “supersize” option;
489 however, the company alleged 
that the decision to stop selling “supersize” portions was entirely unrelated to the film.
490
The food as medicine movement gained further attention with the release of the 2011 documentary, Forks Over Knives.
491 The film 
was the culmination of more than ten years of research by executive producer Brian Wendel into the health effects of a plant-based diet.
492
In the film, he interviews major figures in the plant-based food as medicine movement, including T. Colin Campbell and Caldwell Esselstyn.
493 After the documentary’s release, 
the Forks Over Knives brand has expanded to include multiple cookbooks, a cooking course, and a meal planning service.
494 It has been 
described by many media outlets as a film that, even if it does not convince the audience to turn to completely plant-based diets, will force viewers to think more critically about the food they eat.
495,496
In 2017, director Robert Tate released The 
Magic Pill , which diverted from the plant-based 
focus of Forks Over Knives. In The Magic 
Pill, the health benefits to high-fat, meat-heavy diets (such as the ketogenic diet) are explored.
497 That same year, documentarian 
Kip Andersen released What the Health, which explores the role that big business plays in public health and the epidemic of diet-related disease.
498 Joaquin Phoenix, acclaimed actor 
and vegan activist, acted as an executive producer on the film.
499 The film was criticized 
by reviewers for cherry-picking science studies and distorting scientific data.
500,501,502,503
The cultural impact of this popularization can still be seen today. Numerous professional athletes have publicly extolled the benefits of plant-based diets in particular; former NFL lineman David Carter switched to a vegan diet in 2014 after watching Forks Over 
Knives.
504 The popularity of veganism among 
athletes is the primary focus of Netflix’s 2019 documentary, titled The Game Changers , 
which strongly promotes a plant-based diet.
505
It featured many of the major figures in the Food as Medicine movement, including Dean Ornish, Caldwell Esselstyn, and David Katz, alongside very well-known celebrities such as Arnold Schwarzenegger.
506 This documentary 
highlighted athletes (especially men) who follow vegan diets, using the term “plant-based” in an attempt to broaden the appeal.
507
However, the film was criticized for citing very little reputable research and relying heavily on anecdotal evidence instead.

50   Part I  Food as Medicine:  A Brief History   Part I  Food as Medicine:  A Brief History   51The Impact of Food as 
Medicine Online
According to the National Telecommunications 
and Information Administration (NTIA) in the United States Department of Commerce, more than half of American households used the internet for health-related activities in 2019.
509 In 
its survey , NTIA reported that 
The proportion of households that accessed 
health or health insurance records online grew from 30 percent in 2017 to 34 percent in 2019. Households communicating with a doctor or other health professional online grew by two percentage points, and households that researched health information online grew by one percentage point between 2017 and 2019.
510
As individuals seek to make sense of their 
health, a majority of Americans, at least 60 percent according to some estimations, turn to the internet as a source of medical information.
511,512 Additionally, searching for 
information about nutrition and diet online has increased substantially.
513 According to research
published in PLOS One: 
[W]omen, young users, users with a 
university education and nonsmokers are most likely to use the internet and mobile applications for health-related purposes. On search engines, internet users most frequently search for pharmacies, symptoms of medical conditions and pain. Moreover, users seem most interested in information on how to live a healthy life, alternative medicine, mental health and women’s health.
514
However, with this increased desire for 
information, there is also an increased abundance of misinformation.
515 There is a 
lack of credibility to much of the health, and nutrition-specific information published online.
516
Many health-related blogs and websites corroborate information using experts with advanced health degrees,
517 which causes 
readers of these sites to be more likely to trust the information they find.
518,519 However, online 
health information may still be misleading and have inaccurate claims.
520 In fact, baseless 
trends and sensationalist news reports create opportunities for misinformation to proliferate, providing information that may sometimes be dangerous.
521,522 While some individuals may 
be skeptical of government websites (such as the FDA,
523 USDA,524 and the U.S. National 
Library of Medicine’s MedlinePlus525,526,527) it 
can be valuable in offering a baseline level of information or a starting point, that along with original research from scholarly search engines such as PubMed or Google Scholar, can provide a starting point for individual health information research.
528
The accuracy of information published on websites and blogs is not governed by any regulatory agency; therefore, websites with evidence-based content coexist with those containing inaccurate, incomplete, or misleading information.
529 Nutrition misinformation can be 
disseminated with false intent to sell products530
or promote a personal philosophy or that of a special-interest group.
531 Research has 
routinely shown that consumers who do not have a background in nutrition science often feel confused by information available to them, including information found in studies, news articles, and on social media.
532,533,534,535
Many of the people who use the internet to search for health information have a lack of trust in the traditional medical establishment,
536,537,538,539 which has been 
exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.540
Skeptics of the modern health care system have expressed frustration that their desire to learn about alternative treatment options, including dietary intervention, were largely ignored or even rebuffed by their traditional healthcare provider (which includes physicians).
541 This 
lack of support from the medical system pushed many to seek information on the internet.

Online
By Charles Platkin, PhD, JD, MPH
You wake up one morning and see that you have an unidentified rash on your hand. 
What’s one of the first things you do? Probably, if you’re like most Americans, you go to your smartphone or computer and start searching for what disease you have. The statistics are staggering – nearly 75 percent of Americans are looking online for health information. As Mark Twain said: “Be careful about reading health books.” The reality is you can’t always trust what you read. Here are a few tips from a variety of sources (e.g. the Medical Library Association, NIH’s US National Library of Medicine, Medline Plus and a few other reliable sources) to help make sure your future health searches yield more accurate results.
Who Owns or Is Responsible for the Website and Its Content? 
Ask yourself the following questions:
● Who or what entity created the website or is responsible for the information?
● Does the site have an email address, or is the only way to contact the organization 
through a web or contact form? Make sure their contact information is accurate and detailed.
● Who owns the site? Is there an “About” or “About Us” section? Is it a not-for-profit, and, if so, who is funding? There are some nonprofits that are funded by specific interest groups or corporations. Is it a corporation? If so, what kind—hospital, university, etc.?
● Does it explain the mission and purpose of the website? Is there an address? If you look it up on a search engine “street image,” what does it show?
● Why was the website created? What is its purpose and what do they gain? Is it educational? Corporate? Trying to sell a product or service?
● Does the “About Us” section list names of individuals associated with the site? If there is an individual identified, what are their credentials (PhD, Masters – and from what university? Is it accredited?)?
● Is it clear who they are and what they do for the site? You might even do a search for that person’s name – see what comes up.
● Are the individuals involved with the site backed by a known nonprofit organization (e.g., government, university, or research center)?
● What is the domain name? This is not always the best indicator; however, typically a “.edu” or a “.gov” is a good start, while “.org” is not necessarily a guarantee that it’ s a 
legitimate organization.
● Is there an advisory board? If so, who is on the advisory board?Facts? Opinion? Bias? 
● Check to see if the information on the site is based on the latest scientific research – the “state of the science.” You can always look on pubmed.gov or search in Google Scholar using key words and seeing what research articles show up. You can filter 
results by year too.
● Information should be presented in a clear manner. It should be based on fact and verifiable from primary sources such as professional / scientific literature, peer-reviewed journal articles, and other scholarly researched, university backed sources.
● Is the information showing only one point of view? Check multiple websites, especially university and government research organizations (such as CDC.gov and NIH).
● Information that is opinion should be clearly stated on the website and the source or sources of the information should be identified.
● Are there advertisers or sponsors on the site? Who are they? What type of ads? Keep in mind, most government websites, hospitals, universities and other non-profits don’t take ads or have sponsors.
● Is advertising clearly marked as a sponsored? Many sites create advertorials – advertisements disguised as editorial content or information from reliable health sources.
● Look carefully to see if the site is a front for a corporation, pharmaceutical company, or another biased organization.
● Check the style and display of the site information including the graphics, colors, fonts, and size of text. Watch out for all capital letters, exclamation points, and anything out of the ordinary.
● Has the material been reviewed or vetted by an expert, such as an MD or PhD in the field?
Is the Information Accurate and Timely? 
● Are the sources cited reliable?
● Is there a date on the page?
● When was the last page updated? The site should be updated frequently. Health information changes constantly as new information about diseases and treatments is discovered through research and patient care. What was published a year ago may be outdated now.
● Do the links work?54   Part I  Food as Medicine:  A Brief History   Part I  Food as Medicine:  A Brief History   55● Are there grammatical and spelling errors?
● Are there citations, footnotes/endnotes, bibliographies, or references so that you can 
verify the information? Are these reliable? Do they link to the sources?
● Does the site have a seal of approval from an unbiased accrediting body such as “Health On the Net Foundation (HON)?” HON is a non-profit, non-governmental organization, accredited to the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations. For 15 years, HON has focused on the essential question of the provision of health information to citizens, information that respects ethical standards. (See: https://www.healthonnet.org/)
● If the website is quoting research studies, follow these tips from the Harvard School of Public Health on Deciphering Media Stories:
 οIs the story simply reporting the results of a single study? Only very rarely would a single study be influential enough for people to change their behaviors based on the results. So it is important to see how that study fits in with other studies on the topic. Some articles provide this background; other times, you may need to do more digging on your own.
 οHow large is the study? Large studies often provide more reliable results than small studies.
 οWas the study done in animals or humans? Mice, rats, and monkeys are not people. To best understand how food (or some other factor) affects human health, it must almost always be studied in humans.
 οDid the study look at real disease endpoints, like heart disease or osteoporosis?
Your Privacy Matters
● Your health information should be confidential, and if you research a disease or condition that should also be private.
● There should be a link saying “Privacy” or “Privacy Policy.” Read the privacy policy to see if your privacy is really being protected.

543,544 Additionally, excessive 
searching for online health information has been linked to increased anxiety and distress, a phenomenon known as “cyberchondria.”
545
There are also issues that health information seekers are often frustrated when searching for the medical and health information they want. Approximately 60 percent of health seekers found the process of finding health information frustrating.
546 Furthermore:
[i]n studies published during the last 
decade, persons who reported greater difficulty in seeking health information online were more likely to be from socially disadvantaged groups, including racial/ethnic minority groups, older adults, those with lower incomes, and persons living in rural areas; more likely to report negative perceptions about health care; and more likely to be misinformed about cancer prevention than those from relatively advantaged groups.

As internet literacy improves across the board, 
more and more people will turn to it to answer their health questions without seeking the advice of their healthcare professionals.

Patients want to feel more in control of their health decision making,

tionship with their physicians.550 Researchers 
Sharon Swee-Lin Tan and Nadee Goonawar-dene wrote in the Journal of Medical Internet Research  in 2017 that healthcare profession-
als need to consider ways to adapt their ser-vices in the internet world in order to improve the patient-physician relationship.
551 Key to 
rebuilding trust among patients in their health-care professionals is transparency; people want to know what doctors and other health-care providers are doing and why they are 
doing it.
552,553Food as Medicine on Social Media
In the age of social media, platforms including 
Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok are also increasingly popular sources of health information.
554,555,556,557 Many users turn to 
these sites looking for food-based ways to prevent, manage, and treat disease.
558
The extensive number of pages devoted to using food as medicine attest to this interest among users.
559,560,561 Unfortunately, the 
accessibility of evidence-based information 
about food as medicine has not kept pace with its booming popularity.
562,563,564,565,566
Information circulated on social media and the internet can often be unsound and inaccurate, especially information about food and diet.
567,568,569 Misinformation is extremely 
prevalent in online discourse,570,571 and even 
young, tech-savvy users fall for inaccurate claims on the internet and through social media.
572,573,574,575 Many Americans struggle to 
understand medical information, leaving them susceptible to misinformation spread through social media.
576,577 Research by the Institute 
of Medicine indicates that approximately half the adults in the United States lack the ability to make informed decisions regarding their health, a phenomenon that has been called a “health literacy epidemic.”
578,579  “Health 
literacy” refers to an individual’s ability to take responsibility for his or her health and understand the factors that impact it.
580,581
Often health claims come from social media influencers who profess food-based solutions to common health conditions.
582,583 These 
accounts attract large, eager fan bases with some influencers and have been shown to have a significant impact on the food and health practices of social media users.

the Nutrition Society  conducted across all 
age groups found that a majority of users, 59 percent, followed influencers on social media, 
58   Part I  Food as Medicine:  A Brief History   Part I  Food as Medicine:  A Brief History   59Spotlight: What are Dietary Supplements?
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) maintains that dietary supplements in-
clude vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and herbs or botanicals, as well as other sub-stances that can be used to supplement the diet but are not intended to treat, diagnose, cure, or alleviate the effects of diseases.
587 According to the 2012 National Health Inter-
view Survey, 89 percent of American adults who took dietary supplements other than vitamins and minerals were interested in general wellness or disease prevention and improved immune function, memory, or energy.
588 As the FDA treats dietary supplements 
differently from conventional pharmaceuticals (does not have the authority to review di-etary supplement products for safety and effectiveness before they are marketed), man-ufacturers can make certain kinds of health claims without submitting their product for review by the agency.
589 Companies can promote their products by using statements that 
describe the documented impact of their nutrient ingredients on improving or maintaining the “structure/function” of the human body.
590 “Structure/function” claims are differentiat-
ed from disease claims because they reference the health of an organ or mechanism of the body rather than purporting to impact the signs and symptoms of disease.
591 Some 
dietary supplements have not been proven to work, and studies of some supplements have not supported claims made about them.
592 Although dietary supplements that fea-
ture structure/function statements are required to include disclaimers stating that their products have not been evaluated by the FDA, their claims still entice consumers to buy these products in the hope, often false, of mitigating disease.
593 [See: National Center for 
Complementary and Integrative Health’s Herbs at a Glance and Health Topics A-Z]
The NCCIH supports research into dietary supplements and how they affect the body, and provides information to consumers interested in taking supplements for their health.
594 Some dietary supplements are well-researched and known to be generally 
beneficial for certain conditions, such as melatonin;595 others have little evidence sup-
porting their use, such as echinacea in the treatment of the common cold.596
and 16 percent of users considered the 
opinions of these influencers to have a notable impact on their food choices. 
597
Claims spread via social media platforms such as TikTok are often not only false but potentially dangerous. For example, in the spring of 2021, influencers on TikTok encouraged the use of liquid chlorophyll as a cure for acne.
598 However, some 
dermatologists caution against taking liquid chlorophyll for acne without the guidance of a medical professional because a photosensitizing agent such as chlorophyll can be very damaging to skin as it accumulates and can cause rashes, burning, and stinging.
599,600 The key issue is that this has 
not been tested or scientifically tested and proven to be impactful or safe. There is a high demand for misinformation, and validation of alternative scientific and medical information.  This information has a high believability and low skepticism by the recipients.  
Researchers have used social contagion 
models, which study how people influence one another in belief, affect, and behavior, to demonstrate the important role these popular figures have played in the rise of veganism over the past decade.
601 For many platform 
users, influencers are trusted sources of food information as well as aspirational figures.
602
Followers are eager to emulate their attractive physiques and glamorous lifestyles by following their health advice;
603,604 which, in 
recent years, this advice has attracted many increasingly pushed Americans towards certain diets.
605
Some health claims on social media are funded by companies selling dietary supplements, weight loss products, and other food-based health solutions.
606,607,608
According to a 2017 estimate, at least 75 
percent of advertisers in the United States employ social media influencers as part of their marketing strategy.
609,610 Many of their 
followers are teenagers and young adults—41 percent of TikTok users are between the ages of 16 and 24
611—who are highly responsive to 
messaging that they perceive to come from their peers.
612 As a result, an estimated 60 
percent of food and beverage promotions are now endorsed by social media influencers.

Rising Popularity of Plant-Based 
and Plant- Forward Diets
Plant-based diets are eating patterns that 
emphasize the consumption of foods derived from plants, including fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, oils, whole grains, legumes, and beans.
614,615 Roughly a century ago, 
most people ate predominantly plant-based foodstuffs.
616 Industrialization, which increased 
standards of living while decreasing the costs of meat, fish, and fowl, contributed to animal products to become staples of the American diet.
617,618 Federal subsidies for dairy and 
livestock, in part via subsidies on feed grains, contribute to artificially low meat prices in the United States, making animal-based foods much more affordable and accessible.
619,620
The government in the United States spends more than $38 billion annually on crop insurance and commodity programs for farms (most of which go to the production of corn, soybeans, and other field crops that can be used as feed for livestock);
621,622 however, less 
than one percent of that amount is allocated to fruit and vegetable production due to their status as “specialty crops.”
623,624
The shift towards plant-based eating reflects a variety of changes to how Americans understand and approach their food. Today, some of the most popular plant-based diets, including vegetarianism and veganism, exclude many or all animal products.
625 Other 
plant-based diets emphasize flexitarianism and reducetarianism rather than eliminating all fish, meat, and dairy.

of Type 2 Diabetes Through Diet
In 2016, then-Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams, author of Healthy at Last: 
A Plant-Based Approach to Preventing and Reversing Diabetes and Other Chronic Illnesses  (Hay House Inc., 2020) was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.
628 He lost the 
vision in his left eye and suffered nerve damage in his hands and feet.629
After researching the potential treatment and management options for diabetes, he found Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn’s research, and decided to follow a whole-food, plant-based diet.
630 “I remained skeptical that I could ever enjoy eating this way, but I was 
determined to take charge of my health,” Adams wrote in his 2020 book.631 Within 
months, Adams reversed his type 2 diabetes and now works to educate the community about how to make informed decisions about food.
632
A lifelong New Yorker, Adams was a police officer for 22 years and retired at the rank of captain.
633 He began his first of two terms as the Brooklyn Borough President in 2013—
the first person of color to be elected into the position.634 In 2022, Eric Adams became 
the 110th mayor of New York City.635
fruits, and whole grains—foods that serve 
as the cornerstones of both the USDA’s and the WHO’s dietary guidelines—an individual can improve their nutritional intake and reduce their risk for chronic disease.
636,637,638 
Large observational research studies have found that plant-based eaters have lower rates of heart disease,
639,640,641,642 type 2 
diabetes,643,644 certain types of cancer,645
obesity,646 and hypertension647,648 relative to 
those who do not maintain plant-based diets. In addition, randomized clinical trials have shown that plant-based diets can be effective for the treatment of type 2 diabetes,
649,650
hypertension,651 hyperlipidemia,652 and 
obesity.653 Plant-based diets may provide other 
health benefits as well, including decreased inflammation,
654,655 better kidney health,656,657
and improved gut microbiota profiles;658 in 
addition, a 2021 randomized controlled trial found that in menopausal women, a low-fat, vegan diet supplemented with soybeans led to fewer, less severe hot flashes and improved quality of life.
659
In recent years, a number of studies have highlighted the distinction between healthful plant-based diets, which are rich in minimally processed plant foods, and unhealthful plant-based diets, which emphasize sugar-sweetened beverages, refined grains, fried foods, and other ultra-processed foods.
660
Unhealthful plant-based diets have been linked to higher rates of heart disease
661 and 
type 2 diabetes,662 similar to diets high in 
animal foods. In addition, some plant-based alternatives to animal products may contain similar amounts of saturated fats and added sodium. Thus, as plant-based diets gain popularity, from the health perspective it is important to emphasize the overall quality of these eating patterns. Moreover, as with any eating pattern, fully plant-based diets should be well planned to ensure optimal nutrient intake, including vitamin B12.
663,664Some pursue these diets out of ethical and animal rights concerns, such as the treatment of livestock and the morality of eating other living things.
665,666,667 Some also cite the 
ecological and environmental impact of raising animals for food production, including the creation of methane and a drain on water and land resources, as reasons for turning to plant-based foodstuffs as climate change intensifies.
668,669,670
Although there are several factors contributing to the increase in plant-based eating, the perceived health benefits of these diets play a substantial role in their popularity.
671,672,673,674 
675,676,677 The choice to be a vegan based on 
dietary and health preferences rather than ethical beliefs may have a broader appeal because it is framed as a personal choice to improve one’s physical wellbeing.
678,679,680,681
Plant-based diets have become trendy lifestyle choices advocated for by celebrities and social media influencers.
682,683,684
Plant-based diets have well-established health benefits and are aligned with nutrition recommendations from major medical societies—including the American College of Cardiology / American Heart Association, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinology, the American Cancer Society, and the American Institute for Cancer Research—whereas processed and red meats as well as whole-milk dairy products contain saturated fats that have been linked to the development of cardiovascular disease and obesity.
685,686 Whole grains, fruits, vegetables, 
legumes, nuts, and seeds—foods at the core of plant-based diets—are linked to significantly lower risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, type 2 diabetes, and obesity.
687,688,689
In addition, dietary substitution of plant protein instead of animal protein has been linked to decreased cardiovascular disease mortality risk.

Spotlight: Plant-Based Lifestyle Medicine 
Program, NYC Health + Hospitals/Bellevue
Bellevue Hospital, in the Kips Bay neighborhood of Manhattan, launched a plant-
based diet program in January of 2019 with the support of then-Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams.
691 Called the Plant-Based Lifestyle Medicine Program, this 
resource is designed for patients with chronic diseases and conditions, such as type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, and health concerns related to obesity.
692 Adams was able to get the city to fund $400,000 into launching the 
program,693 and it began with more than 260 patients.694
Participants in the program receive the attention of doctors, a registered dietitian, and a health coach, and each individual’s program is designed to meet their specific goals and health needs.
695 As a lifestyle program, it focuses on more than just diet. There are 
six areas of lifestyle change that participants are supported through: “plant-based diet, physical activity, stress reduction, sleep health, social connections, and avoidance of risky substances such as tobacco.”
696
Many snack and convenience foods, including 
Fritos, Sour Patch Kids, and Oreos, are technically plant-based demonstrating that plant-based doesn’t necessarily mean a food item is healthy.
697 These items are increasingly 
joined in the marketplace by other ultra-processed foods specifically designed as vegetarian and vegan alternatives to animal products.
698,699,700,701,702 Vegans and non-
vegans alike can now reach for oat milk ice cream,
703 pea 
protein “eggs,”704 and plant-
based meat analogues or “fake” meats.
705,706 These 
alternatives often contain the same high levels of added sugar, saturated fat, and sodium as the animal-based foods they mimic and are also implicated in rising rates of obesity and other diet-related diseases.
707,708,709,710 As a 
result of the proliferation and popularity of these products, the term “junk food vegan” has been coined to refer to plant-based eaters who rarely consume whole vegetables, fruits, and grains.
711,712
Food and lifestyle choices, specifically nutritious plant-based diets, can be effective in the management and treatment of disease. This does not discount or eliminate the use of medications or conventional therapeutics, which may also play a powerful role in managing disease and reducing the risk of disease-related complications. Additionally, when plant-based diets are used in conjunction with conventional therapeutics under the guidance and oversight of qualified healthcare professionals, it could lead to a powerful response to all disease.
713,714 In the modern “food as medicine” model, nutrition and medications can be applied together as appropriate to greatly enhance outcomes.
715,716
Evidence-based approaches to food as medicine recognize that a fully plant-based diet may not be accessible/feasible for all patients.
717 Some individuals may lack 
the nutritional knowledge, access to fresh 
produce and plant-based foods, 
and/or cooking skills required to 
implement and maintain such a 
diet.718,719 Others may face social 
and cultural barriers, including 
harsh criticism from friends and family members, that make going plant-based untenable for them.
720
The perceived high cost of a plant-based diet may also be a deterrent, though recent research shows that many plant-based foods are less 
expensive per serving than red meats, poultry, eggs, and seafood.
721 Legumes, for 
example, are rich in protein and fiber and are among the most 
economical foods available. To address these and other barriers to adopting a plant-based diet, culturally sensitive education and support should be made 
readily available (e.g., to patients 
in health care settings) to increase 
their consumption of healthful plant-based foods, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds. Changes in local and national food policies are also warranted to increase access to these foods in all communities. In the end, plant-based diets are tools that many people can implement to enhance their health outcomes, however, they are not necessarily a universal panacea.

Food as Medicine 
Challenges 
Despite the long history of food as medicine 
across history and cultures, as well as its rise in popularity in our modern culture, there remain critical challenges throughout the food ecosystem that may limit the ability for “food as medicine” to be actualized in practice. This section highlights several of these challenges starting with controversies and inconsistencies surrounding dietary guidelines, followed by discussions of efforts to define the term “healthy;” food insecurity, food justice and health equity; insufficient nutrition counseling from clinicians; food marketing; and food industry-funded research. It is important to acknowledge and understand these challenges in order to develop, implement, and evaluate effective, long-term strategies and solutions.
The Impact and Influences of the 
Dietary Guidelines
The Dietary Guidelines 
for Americans
The impact of food and diet on health has 
been used to influence both national and international dietary guidelines intended to prevent and reduce diet-related diseases.
722,723
Every five years, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) release updated Dietary Guidelines to help Americans make informed food and beverage decisions. 
The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines  for 
Americans promote nutrient-dense foods such as vegetables, fruits, and whole grains, and 
discourage overconsumption of foods high in added sugar, saturated fat, and sodium.
724
Although nutritious diets rich in whole foods have been proven to address chronic diseases and obesity, the diets of more than 80 percent of Americans do not meet the U.S. dietary recommendations.
725 Data from the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) showed that only 12.2 percent of American adults met the standard for fruit intake and 9.3 percent for vegetables in 2015, and this rate is even lower among those living in poverty.
726
The Dietary Guidelines are intended to “provide food-based recommendations to 70   PART II  Food as Medicine Challenges   PART II  Food as Medicine Challenges   71promote health, help prevent diet-related 
chronic diseases, and meet nutrient needs;”727
however, it’s important to note that the dietary guidelines are not without criticism and controversy.
728,729 Governmental diet 
regulations are severely politicized and criticized because of their deep connections to corporate interests.
730
For instance, the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee had multiple ties to industry, including the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association, the American Beverage Association, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, Atkins Nutritional, and more.
731,732
Furthermore, according to the New York 
Times, more than half of the committee has ties to the International Life Sciences Institute, a shadow “pro-sugar” group created in 1978 by a Coca-Cola executive.
733 This 
Institute has been described  by the New 
York Times as “almost entirely funded by Goliaths of the agribusiness, food, and pharmaceutical industries,”
734 and presently 
includes companies such as DuPont, PepsiCo, Danone, and General Mills.
735
For many years, food policy advocates and experts have raised concerns that the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee has failed to follow advancements in nutrition science, and often favors recommendations that benefit large food and beverage companies that have significant influence over the process of setting guidelines.
736The food and beverage industry, 
including corporations and trade groups, spends considerable amounts of money lobbying Congress members to influence the federal government’s nutrition standards in addition to local, state, and federal policies.
737 For instance, in 
2018 and 2019, Mars Inc. spent more than $2 million on lobbying efforts related to food policy issues, including the Dietary Guidelines.
738
And in 2020, 28 members of Congress (who have no expertise in nutrition or medicine but presumably spoke to lobbyists or other industry representatives) sent a letter to Sonny Perdue and Alex Azar, former respective heads of the USDA and HHS, challenging the daily recommended alcohol limit for men.
739,740
According to Marion Nestle, PhD, MPH, Paulette Goddard Professor of Nutrition, Food Studies, and Public Health, Emerita, at New York University and author of the books Food Politics: How the Food Industry Influences Nutrition and Health  (Revised 
Edition) (University of California Press, 2013) and Unsavory Truth: How Food Companies Skew the Science of What We Eat (Basic Books, 2018):
The USDA and the US Department of 
Health and Human Services (HHS) have issued Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGAs) every five years since 1980. Because the DGAs influence federal nutrition policy and can affect sales of targeted foods and beverages, they are of intense interest to the food industry. The producers of foods high in saturated fat, sugars, and sodium lobby relentlessly against guidelines suggesting that the intake of meat should be reduced, for example. In response to industry pressures, the 1980 guidelines addressed meat intake only indirectly; they advised Americans to ‘avoid too much fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol.’
741
Furthermore, many experts also argue that 
the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and other sources of nutrition information are overly complicated and confusing to the average consumer.
742,743 A study published 
in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics  in 2013 determined that one  of 
the core barriers to adherence to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans among adults was a “lack of knowledge of recommendation/portion/health benefits.”
744 And a health policy brief
72   PART II  Food as Medicine Challenges   PART II  Food as Medicine Challenges   73Spotlight: Dietary Guidelines for Americans 
2020-2025 (USDA)
The core elements that make up a  
healthy dietary pattern include: 
●Vegetables of all types—dark green; 
red and orange; beans, peas, and  lentils; starchy; and other vegetables
●Fruits, especially whole fruit 
●Grains, at least half of which  are whole grain 
●Dairy, including fat-free or low-fat  milk, yogurt, and cheese, and/or  lactose-free versions, and fortified soy beverages and yogurt  as alternatives 
●Protein foods, including lean meats, poultry, and eggs; seafood; beans, peas, and lentils; nuts, seeds, and soy products 
●Oils, including vegetable oils and oils in food, such as seafood and nuts
The Guidelines recommend:
●Limiting added sugars* to less than 10 percent of calories per day for ages 2 and older and to avoid added sugars for infants and toddlers;
●Limiting saturated fat to less than 10 percent of calories per day starting at age 2;
●Limiting sodium intake to less than 2,300mg per day (or even less if younger than 14);
●Limiting alcoholic beverages* (if consumed) to 2 drinks or less a day for men and 1 drink or less a day for women.
To learn more about the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, see here.
* The Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 recommend limiting intake of added sugars 
and alcoholic beverages, but do not include changes to quantitative recommendations from the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for these two topics, because the new evidence reviewed since the 2015-2020 edition is not substantial enough to support changes to the quantitative recommenda-tions for either added sugars or alcohol.
74   PART II  Food as Medicine Challenges   PART II  Food as Medicine Challenges   75Spotlight: The “Cheeseburger Bill”
In 2002, an overweight man from New York filed a lawsuit against McDonald’s, 
alleging that the fast food chain was at fault for his obesity and diabetes. After this suit, many similar ones were filed across the country,
745 including a lawsuit filed by two 
Bronx teenagers against the McDonald’s Corporation alleging the fast-food giant was responsible for their obesity (the case was dismissed).
746,747 
Obesity lawsuits gained national media attention, and the executives at the fast-food and big-food industries took notice. One possible result of this attention is the Personal Responsibility in Food Consumption Act in 2004, colloquially known as the “Cheese-burger Bill.”
748 The bill was introduced by former Representative Ric Keller (R-FL). The 
law would have protected the food industry, particularly fast-food companies, from law-suits brought by the public based on diet-related disease claims.
749 (It is worth noting 
that Representative Keller received nearly $60,000 from the Food & Beverage industry during his 2004 Congressional campaign.)
750 Former Representative Phil Gingrey (R-
GA), a co-sponsor of the bill, said to Congress, “allowing an individual to sue a restau-rant because the consumer chose to eat there often or chose to eat too much is simply ridiculous and, frankly, it is a dangerous waste of the court’s time. For every frivolous case that takes up a spot on the docket, a legitimate case where an individual is truly harmed and truly needs expeditious judicial review gets pushed farther and farther down the line.”
751 
The Personal Responsibility in Food Consumption Act was passed by the United States House of Representatives in 2004 and again in 2005, although was never brought to a vote in the Senate and thus never became law.
752 In 2009, a similar bill was introduced 
to the House, called the Commonsense Consumption Act.753 This bill, similar in nature to 
the Cheeseburger Bill, “Prohibits new, and requires dismissal of pending, civil actions by any person against a manufacturer, marketer, distributor, advertiser, or seller of food, or a trade association, for any injury related to a person’s accumulated acts of consumption of food and weight gain, obesity, or any associated health condition.”
754 The Common -
sense Consumption Act never made it to a vote on the House floor.755
Supporters of these bills claim that lawsuits against fast  food companies for overconsumption are frivolous, and  that the food industry should not have to be subject to  them.
756 However, criticism centers around the argument  
that the courts themselves, not Congress, should decide  if a lawsuit is frivolous or not.
757 Representative  
Jim McGovern (D-MA) said of the Cheeseburger Bill:  “It is an unnecessary distraction from the real problems  facing the American people.”
758 Another opponent of the  
bill, Representative Sheila Jackson-Lee (D-TX), said to  Congress, “Having such a restrictive rule truly goes too  
far and limits the protections of the American people.”

760,761
By only listing nutrients to “avoid,” the Dietary Guidelines for Americans places the onus on the consumer to know which nutrients are in which foods and beverages. Expecting all Americans to know exactly what foods contain saturated fats, sodium, or added sugars can complicate making informed decisions; instead, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans should educate the public about the foods they eat and their nutritional components.
762
Dietary Guidelines from the World 
Health Organization
On a global level, the World Health 
Organization (WHO) also issues dietary guidelines, recognizing the role that a healthy diet has in preventing malnutrition and many chronic diseases. The WHO’s guidelines promote eating whole foods such as vegetables, fruits, legumes, and whole grains, and recommend a limited consumption of added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium.
763
See a summary of the guidelines below:
Healthy Diet — World Health

A healthy diet includes the following:
●Fruit, vegetables, legumes (e.g. lentils 
and beans), nuts and whole grains (e.g. unprocessed maize, millet, oats, wheat and 
brown rice).
●At least 400 g (i.e. five portions) of fruit and vegetables per day, excluding potatoes,

noted the confusion the guidelines create for the average American, stating that: 
While accessible to the layperson, the 
[Dietary Guidelines for Americans] are intended for policy makers and nutrition and health professionals, and they include ample footnotes citing numerous studies. There are also fourteen appendices, including one each on the three different food patterns and four on different food sources ranging from fiber to vitamin D. There are recommended amounts of different nutrients based on twelve different daily calorie needs, which are further subdivided by an individual’s age, sex, and level of physical activity.
764
The Dietary Guidelines for Americans 
promote the consumption of specific foods, such as fruits and vegetables, which is straightforward enough for consumers to understand. However, in the section about what to avoid, the guidelines do not provide a list of specific foods, but rather tell consumers to limit intake of certain nutrients, such as saturated fats, sodium, and sugars,
765 which 
requires individuals to have a knowledge about these nutrients and the foods and beverages that contain them. For instance, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans say, eat more fruits and less “saturated fats.”
766
The average consumer can determine the difference between fruit from non-fruit, but may not be able to discern between different types of fat (saturated, unsaturated, trans).
767
In fact, according to a 2009 study appearing in Annals of Nutrition and Metabolism  across 16 
countries, most consumers do not even know what saturated fat is.
768  
The guidelines also state that consumers should limit their intake of added sugars.
769
However, this requires consumers to know which foods and beverages contain added sugar (e.g. cereals, yogurts, condiments, 
78   PART II  Food as Medicine Challenges   PART II  Food as Medicine Challenges   79●Less than 10 percent of total energy intake 
from free sugars, which is equivalent to 50 g (or about 12 level teaspoons) for a person of healthy body weight consuming about 2,000 calories per day, but ideally is less than 5 percent of total energy intake for additional health benefits. Free sugars are all sugars added to foods or drinks by the manufacturer, cook or consumer, as well as sugars naturally present in honey, syrups, fruit juices and fruit juice concentrates.
●Less than 30 percent of total energy intake comes from fats. Unsaturated fats (found in fish, avocado and nuts, and in sunflower, soybean, canola and olive oils) are preferable to saturated fats (found in fatty meat, butter, palm and coconut oil, cream, cheese, ghee and lard) and trans-fats of all kinds, including both industrially-produced trans-fats (found in baked and fried foods, and pre-packaged snacks and foods, such as frozen pizza, pies, cookies, biscuits, wafers, and cooking oils and spreads) and ruminant trans-fats (found in meat and dairy foods from ruminant animals, such as cows, sheep, goats and camels). It is suggested that the intake of saturated fats be reduced to less than 10 percent of total energy intake and trans-fats to less than 1 percent of total energy intake. In particular, industrially-produced trans-fats are not part of a healthy diet and should be avoided.
●Less than 5 g of salt (equivalent to about one teaspoon) per day. Salt should be iodized.
●To learn more about the World Health Organization’s guidelines for a healthy diet, see here.According to a study published in The Lancet
which looked at the “consumption of major foods and nutrients across 195 countries and quantified the impact of their suboptimal intake on [non-communicable disease] mortality and morbidity,” from 1990-2017, consumption of almost all nutritious foods (nutrient-dense foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins) and nutrients are below the recommended levels.
770 Simultaneously, the 
daily intake of unhealthy foods and nutrients are higher than the recommended level, with the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages being far higher than the optimal level at 49 grams per day
771 (the American 
Heart Association recommends a daily sugar intake in the United States of 37 grams for men, 25 grams for women,
772 and less than 
25 grams for children ages 2-18773). The 
consumption of processed meat, red meat, and sodium exceed recommended levels as well, which is considered unhealthy according to study researchers.
774 In general, men have 
a higher intake of both “healthy and unhealthy foods” than women; intake of healthy and unhealthy foods are highest among adults aged 50-69 years, and lowest among adults aged 25-49 years; and sugar-sweetened beverages and legume consumption are highest among young adults and decreased with age.
775
In addition to the negative impact that unhealthy foods such as red meat and processed meat can have on health, the study also reported that there is mounting evidence that has emerged over the past decade demonstrating that shifting diet from animal-based to plant-forward (e.g. fruit, vegetables, and whole grains) might be associated with lower greenhouse gas emissions, thereby making it more environmentally sustainable.
776
The WHO notes that the exact composition of a healthy, well-balanced diet will vary not only among age, gender, degree of activity, Dietary Guidelines Around 
the World
In addition to the WHO’s global nutrition 
recommendations and guidelines mentioned above,
777 many countries around the world 
have their own national dietary guidelines and recommendations, catered to the cultures, eating habits, and food availability that they represent.
778 The Food and Agriculture 
Organization of the United Nations (FAO)notes that dietary guidelines “provide advice on foods, food groups and dietary patterns to provide the required nutrients to the general public to promote overall health and prevent chronic diseases.”
779 A study published in 2016 
in the journal Advances in Nutrition  stated 
that “dietary guidelines provide evidence-based statements on food choices to meet nutritional requirements and reduce the risk of prevailing chronic disease. They involve a substantial amount of research translation, and their implementation has important health consequences.”
780 Therefore, dietary 
guidelines can be used in food as medicine interventions by providing research that can help healthcare professionals craft individually-tailored dietary recommendations. Additionally, dietary guidelines attempt to promote good health through diet, which can help reduce the 
prevalence of diet-related diseases.
Eat For Health: Australian Dietary 
Guidelines781
The five guidelines:
●To achieve and maintain a healthy weight, 
be physically active and choose amounts of nutritious food and drinks to meet your energy needs.
οEnjoy varied foods from five major food 
groups every day. The five groups are vegetables and legumes, fruits, grains and cereals, lean meats and other proteins, and dairy products.
οDrink plenty of water.and lifestyle, but also among different cultures, 
dietary customs, and the availability and affordability of nutritious foods.
782 In many 
low-income countries, nutritious diets can be unaffordable for the average household, thus impacting consumption.
783 This problem was 
described in the 2020 Global Nutrition Report :
For consumers to be able to purchase 
and consume healthy foods that are available within the food environment, such foods need to be affordable. For the most vulnerable groups of the population, nutrient-rich foods such as animal-source foods, fruits and vegetables are not affordable. Both price levels and volatility affect household purchasing power, welfare and food security, and nutrition.
784
These data highlight the critical need to both 
understand and address other key factors influencing healthy food consumption. Evidence-based dietary guidelines alone cannot improve healthy diets and address the burden of diet-related diseases.
785
In 1963, the WHO and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) established the Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC). The WHO and FAO tasked the CAC with developing a joint FAO/WHO food standards program and creating the Codex Alimentarius, “a collection of standards, guidelines and codes of practice” that protect the safety, quality, and fairness of food traded internationally.
786,787 The Codex 
is a reference guide, with no regulatory authority or enforcement abilities.
788 The 
CAC is composed of 189 member states,789
and meets multiple times per year to ensure all Standards , Guidelines , and Codes of 
Practice are up-to-date and backed by “sound scientific evidence.”

Various countries across the world have passed “traffic light” food labeling laws. These 
labels attempt to help consumers determine the healthiness of various products with a clear visual aid.
795 Traffic light labels range from green-yellow-red (green is best, red is 
worst) to determine the healthfulness of a product based on a variety of factors, which might include sodium, added sugar, saturated fat, calories, and more. Countries that have adopted traffic-light labeling practices include Ecuador,
796 the United Kingdom,797
and Sri Lanka.798 Furthermore, the Department of Education in the state of Western 
Australia uses a traffic light system to determine if certain foods are allowed in the cafeterias.
799
Studies about the effectiveness of traffic-light labels have mixed results; generally, consumers notice the labels and are aware of what they mean.
800,801,802,803 However, this 
awareness does not always translate to changes in purchasing habits.804,805 Furthermore, 
alternative labeling practices have proven to be more effective at altering purchasing habits, such as France’s Nutri-Score system
806,807 and warning labels.808 While somewhat 
impactful, in a 2019 study of consumer habits regarding traffic light labels vs. brand identification, researchers found that consumers are more likely to trust a brand with which they are already familiar and disregard any information on the traffic-light label.

An Attempt to Define the Terms 
“Healthy” and “Unhealthy” 
Common advice given to individuals seeking 
to improve their health is to “eat healthy” or to keep up a “healthy diet.” But what, exactly, are “healthy foods”? “Healthy” or related terms (such as “health,” “healthful,” “healthfulness,” “healthfully,” “healthier,” “healthiest,” 
Spotlight: Healthy Eating Defined and Deconstructed by 
Charles Platkin, PhD, JD, MPH815
The term “healthy eating” is mentioned all the time — in the media, by academics, government 
discussions, social settings, and almost everywhere you go when health is discussed. The problem is that the term probably has hundreds if not thousands of definitions. I once asked a class full of nutrition students to define the term, and their responses were amazing. They used words and phrases such as “balanced,” “moderation,” “good for you,” “no GMOs and organic,” “filled with nutrients,” and “nutritious.” However, many of those definitions need definitions themselves. Very confusing. I decided to reach out to some of the world’s experts on health and nutrition to find some answers. Here is what I found: 
Colin Campbell, Jacob Gould Schurman Professor Emeritus of Nutritional Biochemistry at Cor-
nell University, co-author of The China Study  and Founder of nutritionstudies.org
“Healthy eating and/or the term nutrition is the biological expression of food that creates health for individuals, for society and for the planet. Health is provided by a variety of plant-based foods com-posed of countless nutrients and nutrient-like substances acting “wholistically,” from consumption and digestion to tissue function, and is best obtained by consuming whole foods, not individual nutrients derived therefrom.
The effects of eating this way are exceptionally broad, simultaneously maintaining health and prevent-
ing and treating a broad range of illnesses and diseases. Healthy eating should not only be taught in medical schools but should also be a medical specialty, which would allow the practitioners to be reim-bursed for services.”
David L. Katz, MD, MPH, author of  The Truth about Food . and founder of True Health Initiative
“To me, ‘healthy’ does NOT mean changing weight as fast as possible. It means fostering vitality and 
longevity; adding years to life and life to years. And since there can be no truly healthy people on a sick and ravaged planet, it also means sustainable – friendly to the planet, the climate, to biodiversity, to the permafrost and the rain forests. Aggregate the massive available information we have on these topics from diverse sources- from science, sense, and the global consensus of expert – and you get a very clear articulation of the theme: a diet made up MOSTLY of minimally processed vegetables, fruits, whole grains, beans/legumes, nuts and seeds, with plain water the go-to answer for thirst. Get those fundamentals right – wholesome foods in a balanced, sensible assembly – and you simply can’t go too far wrong!”
Marion Nestle, PhD, Professor, of Nutrition, Food Studies, and Public Health Emerita at New 
York University and author of How Food Companies Skew the Science of What We Eat“What ‘healthy eating’ is turns out to be so simple that the journalist Michael Pollan can do it in seven words: “Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.” Really, that’s all there is to it. Those seven words re -
flect plenty of evidence that diets that follow these principles–a wide variety of relatively unprocessed foods (including many of plant origin) in amounts that balance calorie intake with expenditure–are associated with prevention of weight gain and the chronic diseases for which it is a risk factor. What I like so much about these principles is that they provide plenty of room for enjoying food as one of life’s greatest pleasures.” 
Urvashi Rangan, PhD, Chief Science Advisor, GRACE Communications Foundation and Found-
er of FoodPrint.org“How ingredients are produced and processed and packaged all impact the health of our eating. Pesticides, chemicals, drugs, heavy metals, many food additives and aids won’t be found on the la -
bel when they are used. Supporting food choices from progressive, biodynamic, regenerative, pas-ture-based or real organic food producers is a powerful way to support real sustainable and healthy food choices.”88   PART II  Food as Medicine Challenges   PART II  Food as Medicine Challenges   89
“healthiness,” and “healthily”) have been 
defined  by the United States Food & Drug 
Administration (FDA) since 1993 with primary reference to total fat content.
816 Changes were 
made in 2016 to differentiate between different types of fat.
817,818,819 To be defined as “healthy” 
today, foods must be low in total fat, but also low in saturated fat, meet certain cholesterol and sodium specifications, and provide at least 10 percent of the recommended daily intake of protein, fiber, and certain vitamins or minerals, such as Vitamin A, Vitamin C, calcium and iron.
820,821 It is important to note that nutrient 
criteria used to define what is “healthy” varies among different food categories, including fruits, vegetables, seafood, and meat.
822
However, the term “healthy” still creates confusion for many people.
823,824 In a 2018 
survey of more than 1,000 American adults, about 15 percent said that if a food was labeled “healthy,” they could eat as much of it as they wanted; approximately 40 percent said that the label healthy means they at least should eat more of this type of food; and approximately 35 percent said a healthy label would mean nothing to them.
825 Meanwhile, 
nearly all those surveyed said that fresh vegetables were healthy.
826
While there was an overall consensus in the survey around defining vegetables as healthy, there was less consensus about what it means to eat healthy and make healthy food choices,
827 suggesting that 
terms like “healthy” and “unhealthy” are potentially confusing for average people. Furthermore, food that is called “healthy” is often perceived by consumers as less tasty, more expensive, or more difficult to find than food that is “unhealthy.”
828,829,830,831
Redefining the term “healthy” and educating consumers about what the term means is critical because the perceived healthfulness of food products, whether through a label, educational campaign, or lifelong belief, can have a large influence on the dietary decisions consumers make.
832,833
Food Insecurity, Food Justice, and Health Equity 
Food insecurity is defined  by the USDA as “a 
household-level economic and social condition of limited or uncertain access to adequate food”
834 and is associated with an increased 
risk of diet-related diseases.835 Food insecurity 
plays a significant role in the prevalence and treatment of diseases, and their associated health outcomes.
836,837,838 Many underserved 
communities suffer disproportionately from obesity, heart disease, diabetes, and asthma as a result of food insecurity and diets lacking in nutrient-dense food.
839 A 2021 review
of recent research published in Current 
Nutrition Reports noted a strong correlation 
between food insecurity and risk factors for cardiometabolic conditions (which include but are not limited to obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and heart failure)
840 among adults.841 Reducing food insecurity is critical 
to improving health.842 Food as medicine 
programs and interventions designed not only to reduce food insecurity but to also increase access to nutritious foods such as fruits and vegetables have been successful in improving health among food insecure populations.
843,844
In addition to reducing food insecurity and improving health, these food as medicine programs and interventions, such as nutrition incentive programs
845 and medically tailored 
meals,846 help ensure that vulnerable 
populations have access to fresh, nutritious foods. Promoting access to nutritious foods is a core component of food justice; while the definition may vary, food justice may be defined as “‘the struggle against racism, 90   PART II  Food as Medicine Challenges   PART II  Food as Medicine Challenges   91exploitation, and oppression taking place 
within the food system that addresses inequality’s root causes both within and beyond the food chain.”
847,848 These structural 
barriers include race and class, among others, as food insecurity disproportionately impacts racial and ethnic minorities as well as low-income individuals and families.
849,850,851,852,853
An analysis  completed by the USDA of food 
insecurity trends from 2001 to 2016 found that the rates for both non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic households were at least twice that of non-Hispanic White households. 
854
The burden of obesity and complications from conditions such as heart disease,
855,856
stroke,857,858 type 2 diabetes,859,860 and multiple 
types of cancer861 are also higher among 
Black and Brown communities than White communities.
862,863,864
Furthermore, communities of color and low-income communities often have limited access to nutritious food
865 and more frequently live 
in areas referred to as food deserts, which are defined  by the USDA as areas with limited 
access to affordable and healthy food.
866 Black 
and Hispanic neighborhoods have fewer large supermarkets with fewer nutritious options than White neighborhoods, regardless of the community’s income level.
867 A study in 
Preventive Medicine  examined data from 
the 2000 US Census and 2001 InfoUSA food store data and determined that both the poverty level and the racial composition of a neighborhood impacted access to nutritious food, and “[p]oor predominantly black neighborhoods face a double jeopardy with the most limited access to quality food.”
868
Individuals without access to affordable nutritious foods often have to settle for cheaper, high-calorie alternatives that are more readily available in their communities, which directly impacts the prevention and treatment of disease.
869 Local, state, and 
national policymakers have, therefore, turned their attention to equalizing access to nutritious food as a means of improving public health.
870,871,872 For example, efforts have been 
made to incentivize convenience stores and bodegas to sell more nutrient-rich foods,
873
expand street produce-cart programs,874 and 
improve school lunch food by offering more nutritious options and universal free breakfast and lunch, which is a key source of nutrition for many children from low-income families.
875
In addition to improving access to nutritious food, some legislation attempts to limit access to unhealthy foods; this includes laws that target the fast-food industry and the commercial food sector.
876,877,878,879 In 
2008, New York City became the first U.S. jurisdiction to mandate calorie-labeling on chain restaurant menus.
880 In 2015, the FDA 
ruled that food manufacturers would have to eliminate artificial trans fats from their products by 2018.
881 However, many barriers, 
including a lack of coordination amongst policymakers attempting to improve food access, still impede access to healthy food for all communities.
882,883
Municipal and federal governments are not the only stakeholders taking a greater interest in food justice and health equity. Food justice advocates continue to pressure the federal government to cut subsidies for sugar and corn.
884,885,886 These cuts would increase the 
price of the processed foods and soda that the crops are used to create, potentially severing the link between low-income consumers and nutrient-poor diets.
887 In addition, the United 
Nations (UN) includes “Zero Hunger” as one of its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), with core tenets of “food security and improved nutrition.”
888 The connections 
between food, disease, and health equity within communities around the globe are a growing area of scientific, political, and moral interest.
889,890,891

“attain his or her full health potential” and no one is “disadvantaged from achieving this potential because of social position or other socially determined circumstances.” Health disparities or inequities are types of unfair health differences closely linked with social, economic, or environmental disadvantages that adversely affect groups of people.
892
Increasing evidence has demonstrated 
that individuals living in low-income and underserved communities are disproportionately impacted by diet-related disease and chronic health conditions.
893
Health equity advocates argue that these health disparities are not incidental
894 but are 
the product of systemic social inequalities such as racism, classism, and sexism.
895 Given 
that nutritious food is a critical component of a healthy life,
896 health equity overlaps 
significantly with food justice, which seeks to understand how these systemic social inequalities impact the food system and access to nutritious food.
897
Food Insecurity and Food as 
Medicine Interventions
Food as medicine interventions, such as 
medically tailored meals, medically tailored groceries, and produce prescription programs, have demonstrated positive outcomes in reducing food insecurity and improving health.
898 According to an analysis  in the 
journal BMJ: 
Referring patients to food is medicine 
interventions can change their ability to follow dietary recommendations, tackling several barriers to healthy eating, including the inability to afford or access recommended foods. Providing food or food focused financial assistance can also alleviate budget constraints that prevent patients from affording medications and paying bills. Some food is medicine Changing how researchers, policymakers, and 
advocates define and refer to communities that lack access to nutritious foods (e.g. food deserts) is critical in taking a more ecological approach to address food insecurity. This approach includes examining what current resources, skills, and efforts already exist in these neighborhoods. Additionally, redefining terms such as “food desert” is important for designing food as medicine interventions and programs to improve access to nutritious, fresh foods. While the term “food desert” is used widely to describe communities and neighborhoods lacking access to fresh foods, many studies and activists argue that “food desert” is an inaccurate term, because it conceals the vibrant life and food systems in these communities and implies that, like actual deserts, these areas are naturally occurring.
899
The term may also be considered misleading because it draws focus away from the underlying causes of lack of access to healthy food.
900 In an interview with art and politics 
magazine Guernica , food justice advocate 
Karen Washington argued  that instead of using 
the term “food desert,” we should use “food apartheid” because:
...food apartheid looks at the whole food 
system, along with race, geography, faith, and economics. You say ‘food apartheid’ and you get to the root cause of some of the problems around the food system. It brings in hunger and poverty. It brings us to the more important question: What are some of the social inequalities that you see, and what are you doing to erase some of the injustices?
901
Using the term “food apartheid” to address 
food justice disparities calls for an approach to the food system that acknowledges the role of race and class as well as geography and economics.
902
Access to nutritious food is a critical component of food justice,
903 as well as the 
emerging field of health equity.904 According to 
the CDC, health equity is achieved:
94   PART II  Food as Medicine Challenges   PART II  Food as Medicine Challenges   95interventions model appropriate portion 
size and ingredient selection, enabling recipients to maintain more healthful diets past the intervention duration. Clinicians who refer patients to food is medicine interventions might also see better disease management and fewer admissions to hospital. A patient with diabetes who typically runs out of food when monthly assistance is exhausted, for example, could be given anticipatory nutrition guidance and vouchers for supplemental food to avoid an episode of hypoglycaemia.
905
Another 2019 study in the Journal of General 
Internal Medicine  reported improved dietary 
quality and reduced hypoglycemia among 
food insecure adults with diabetes who were receiving medically-tailored meals.
906
Food insecurity for low-income individuals and families is often compounded and shaped by many overlapping issues, such as lack of affordable housing, chronic or acute health problems, high medical costs, social isolation, low wages, and unemployment.
907 These 
types of issues are called “social determinants of health,” defined as the social, physical, and economic conditions where people live, go to school, work, and play that influence their health.
908,909There is a growing body of 
research and acceptance among academics, advocates, and healthcare professionals that health outcomes and disparities are more frequently driven by these social determinants, such as food insecurity and access to adequate nutrition, than by medical care alone.
910,911
Poverty and food insecurity, which are closely related,
912 correlate with some of the most 
serious and costly health problems in the United States.
913,914,915 In a study of patient 
admissions from 2000-2008 published in Health Affairs, researchers found that risk for hypoglycemia admission increased at the end of the month, when food budgets were depleted.916 The authors noted that 
“policy solutions to improve stable access to nutrition in low-income populations and raise awareness of the health risks of food insecurity might be warranted.”
917
Food insecurity and access to nutritious food were urgent problems before the pandemic, impacting 13.7 million Americans in 2019.
918
During the COVID-19 pandemic, food insecurity has increased significantly
919,920 and 
is now one of the most prominent health crises and health equity challenges in the United States, impacting as many as one in four Americans.
921,922 Many families experiencing 
poverty and food insecurity rely on low-cost foods, which are often unhealthy and low in nutrition, and exacerbate chronic conditions such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and hypertension.
923 It should also 
be noted that those with increased risk factors for cardiometabolic conditions are also at increased risk for adverse health outcomes, hospitalization, and death from COVID-19.
924  
However, not as many older adults enroll in SNAP as are eligible.
925 There are many 
administrative barriers to participating in SNAP that can be difficult for older adults to overcome, such as complicated recertification processes and processing delays.
926 In a 2021 
study of 5,093 older adults enrolled in SNAP in North Carolina, researchers determined that participation was associated with fewer inpatient admissions and lower health care costs.
927 Yet, SNAP participation among 
eligible older adults is less than 50 percent.928
Craig Gundersen, PhD, the Snee Family Endowed Chair at the Baylor Collaborative on Hunger and Poverty, called this an “important study,” noting that food banks have the potential to help older adults enroll in SNAP, indirectly helping them keep medical costs down.
929
Improved food security and nutritious food access can have a significant impact on healthSpotlight: New York City “Health Bucks”
In 2005, the New York City Department of Health began issuing Health Bucks, which 
are $2 coupons that can be used to purchase fresh fruits and vegetables at any of New York City’s farmers’ markets.
930 Since Health Bucks were first distributed they have been 
used to purchase more than $5 million worth of fresh fruits and vegetables at farmers’markets across the city.
931 Each year, community organizations (including faith-based 
organizations) can apply to receive Health Bucks, which they then distribute to members in an effort to encourage knowledge about nutrition and access to fresh produce.
932
In addition to those distributed by community organizations, there are other ways for people to acquire Health Bucks. People who receive any kind of food assistance money, including SNAP and P-EBT, receive Health Bucks as a bonus when they use their EBT cards at farmers’ markets in the city.
933 For every $2 spent at the market, individuals 
receive a $2 match in Health Bucks, capped at $10 per day.934 Markets that accept EBT 
include GrowNYC’s Greenmarkets, Farmstands, and Fresh Food Box sites,935,936 and, 
taken together, they distributed $616,820 in Health Bucks in 2020 alone.937 This was 
approximately two-thirds of all the Health Bucks distributed in NYC that year,938 making 
GrowNYC the largest single distributor of Health Bucks in the city.
Prior to 2021, residents could receive Health Bucks through a program called Pharmacy 
to Farm Prescriptions. SNAP-receiving individuals with high blood pressure were able to receive $30 in Health Bucks when they filled their medication prescriptions at participating pharmacies.
939 This program began in 2017, and expanded to include 15 
pharmacies across Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens.940 By 2019, the program had 
enrolled more than 1,000 participants and distributed more than $85,000 worth of Health Bucks.

96   PART II  Food as Medicine Challenges   PART II  Food as Medicine Challenges   97Food Insecurity Nutrition Incentives [FINI] 
Program), is a USDA food insecurity incentive program named for Gus Schumacher, who was a pioneer in advocating for increased consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables among participants in food assistance programs such as SNAP.
942,943 According to the 
USDA: 
The GusNIP grant program presents the 
opportunity to bring together stakeholders from various parts of the food and health care systems to foster understanding of how they might improve the health and nutrition status of participating households 1) receiving incentives through the purchase of fruits and vegetables, 2) prescribed fresh fruits and vegetables in addition to nutrition educational opportunities, and 3) offer incentive program training and technical assistance to applicants and grantees, facilitating growth in states with low participation, and collecting and aggregating core data sets from eligible entities through a central system to capture program success and identify best practices and areas to improve on a broad scale.
944
GusNIP includes produce prescription 
programs for which doctors prescribe fruits and vegetables, usually for a reduced price, to improve health outcomes during routine visits.
945
Research has demonstrated that produce prescription programs can improve local fruit and vegetable consumption, nutrition knowledge, and food purchasing practices.
946,947 One 2020 study appearing in 
Current Developments in Nutrition  assessed 
the impact of a fruit and vegetable prescription program on the health outcomes and behaviors of Navajo children aged six and under. 
948 Native American and Alaska Native 
populations were found to have higher than average childhood obesity rates, and food insecurity is a significant component outcomes and health care costs, and food-based government policies are needed to enable these improvements at a national-level. In fact, in the United States, SNAP has been successful in reducing food security for more than 50 years.
949,950,951 In August 2021, the 
administration of President Joe Biden revised the nutrition standards of SNAP, prompting an increase of more than 25 percent to average benefits—the largest permanent increase to benefits in the program’s history.
952 Prior to 
this increase, SNAP benefits had not been permanently increased since 2006.
953 This 
increase will provide beneficiaries with more money to afford nutritious food, as most participants in the program exhaust their benefits before the end of the month.
954
Nutrition Incentive Programs Increase 
Vegetable and Fruit Consumption Improving Health Outcomes 
Federal food assistance programs such as 
SNAP have been shown to significantly reduce food insecurity.
955 However, many SNAP users 
have reported difficulty in accessing and affording nutritious foods, and consumption of fruits and vegetables in SNAP households remains significantly below recommendations in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.
956,957
One promising approach to addressing these nutritional deficits are nutrition incentive programs, which are designed to improve access to fruits and vegetables among low-income populations by reducing the cost burden of these foods.
958,959 Many of these 
programs work by providing socioeconomically disadvantaged people with more purchasing power to be used on fresh produce.
960,961 This 
increased purchasing power is offered in the form of rebates, coupons, vouchers, matching SNAP funds spent on produce at farmers’ markets, or other cash equivalents that can be used to purchase fruits and vegetables.
962
The Gus Schumacher Nutrition Incentive Program (GusNIP, formerly known as the 
98   PART II  Food as Medicine Challenges   PART II  Food as Medicine Challenges   99of this disparity. A local nonprofit teamed 
up with local healthcare providers to launch the Navajo Fruit and Vegetable Prescription (FVRx) Program with the aim of addressing the high childhood obesity rates among this population. At the conclusion of the six month program, participants reported a significant decrease in food insecurity (from 82 percent to 65 percent), and 38 percent of children previously categorized as overweight or obese had achieved a healthy BMI.
963
GusNIP also includes Double Up programs, which provide funds to SNAP recipients to increase or match government nutrition benefits and enable low-income families to buy more fresh fruits and vegetables (and sometimes other healthy foods) at local markets.
964,965 For instance, the Double Up 
Food Bucks program in Iowa provides $1 in Double Up Food Bucks for every $1 spent by SNAP users on fresh fruits and vegetables for up to $10 per day.
966 In New York City, the Get 
the Good Stuff program, launched in 2019, allows SNAP users to purchase eligible fruits, vegetables and beans and receive $1 on a program loyalty card for every $1 they spend at four participating supermarkets, capped at $50.
967 The Health Bucks  program, also 
in New York City, offers $2 in Health Bucks (which can be used to purchase fresh fruits and vegetables) for every $2 spent at farmers’ markets using SNAP for up to $10 per day.
968
Finally, the Washington State Food Insecurity Nutrition Initiative  offers SNAP recipients 
cash-value matching at farmers’ markets; a 30 percent discount at Safeway supermarkets for qualifying produce items; and a $10 produce prescription from eight participating health systems in the state that can be redeemed at Safeway supermarkets.
969
Nutrition incentive programs, such as the produce prescriptions programs and the Double Up programs, have demonstrated success in increasing fruit and vegetable consumption,970 particularly among individuals 
living in under-resourced communities.971
Produce prescription programs have been known to improve health outcomes especially among people with diet-related chronic diseases.
972,973 A study in the Journal of 
Nutrition Education and Behavior reported an 
increase in fruit and vegetable spending in a rural low-income community in Maine with a double-dollar pricing incentive, primarily among customers who were eligible for SNAP.
974
Over the last decade, nutrition incentive programs have expanded widely across the United States as an evidence-based solution to increasing fruit and vegetable consumption among food insecure individuals.
975 These 
incentive programs have been reported to reduce food insecurity,
976,977 and increase fruit 
and vegetable consumption for individuals with diabetes,
978 heart disease,979 hypertension,980
and obesity.981,982 These programs, which 
increase the purchasing power of fruits and vegetables among SNAP users, have a significant impact in helping low-income individuals, particularly those experiencing food insecurity, manage and treat chronic illness by significantly reducing costs for fruit and vegetables and improving access to nutritious food. Increasing fruit and vegetable consumption has been proven to impact both the prevention and treatment of disease
983
and demonstrates the importance of food as medicine programs and interventions. However, since many of these programs operate in conjunction with SNAP benefits, there are certain populations that are unable to participate in these programs, such as undocumented immigrants who are ineligible for SNAP.
984Supporting Access to Food Resources
While nutrition incentive programs have proven to be successful in reducing food insecurity
985,986 and increasing fruit and 
vegetable consumption among individuals with diabetes,
987 heart disease,988 hypertension,989
and obesity,990,991 research has also 
suggested that economic hardship is a barrier to maximum program participation and sustainability.
992 In a 2019 study published in 
the journal Translational Behavioral Medicine
that focused on a program providing farmers’ market vouchers, patients enrolled in the produce prescription program reported the following obstacles to full participation: 1) transportation issues impacted shopping and eating behaviors and limited access to farmers’ markets to use fruit and vegetable prescription vouchers; 2) limited and unreliable income affected shopping and eating patterns before, during, and after the program; 3) individual influences such as personal or perceived motivations for program participation impacted program engagement.
993
Additionally, a 2018 analysis of produce prescription programs published in the AMA Journal of Ethics reported that despite reducing financial burdens and increasing access to fruits and vegetables, prescription programs might have unintended psychosocial consequences on low-income participants such as negative feedback loops, coupon stigma, transportation issues, and the limitation of grocery shopping locations  .
994 These 
studies demonstrate that solely improving access to nutritious foods may not be enough, programs need to combine and incorporate other interventions, including nutrition and food education, transportation, cooking materials, and additional resources, including financial support. 
Food as medicine programs that develop 
and implement linkages between clinics and community organizations can increase existing resources and also improve service delivery.
995,996,997 A unique produce prescription 
program  in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, formed 
a broad collaboration of partners including academics, clinical partners, public health professionals, and a local extension center to design, coordinate, and guide the implementation of the program.
998,999
The program was piloted in 2014 with the goal to increase fruit and vegetable consumption and increase healthy birth outcomes among expectant or new mothers, expanding in 2015 to include individuals with hypertension.
1000 Participants reported 
visiting at least one farmers’ market along with increased communication with healthcare providers related to diet. In addition, these participants exhibited significant changes in dietary behavior, including increased fruit and vegetable consumption and decreased fast food consumption.
1001 This food as 
medicine program proved to be a successful model for improving fruit and vegetable consumption among food-insecure patients with hypertension by connecting a broad collaboration of partners with farmers’ markets to promote the use of community food resources.

Primary Care Physicians and Food
Despite the evidence connecting food and diet 
to health, nutrition counseling is not frequently provided by clinicians (including primary care physicians) to their patients.
1003 It has been 
shown that patients who receive advice from their doctors regarding weight loss are more likely to improve their diet, increase activity, and lose weight.
1004 Therefore, physician-
delivered counseling on diet and nutrition may be particularly effective at changing patient behavior and improving their understanding of recommended dietary patterns.
1005,1006 Patient 
interest in nutrition also reflects a desired trend in health care: a shift from disease management and treatment toward preventive care, in which diet plays a key role.
1007 If 
nutrition counseling is such an effective tool that healthcare providers could use to improve patient health, then why is it provided so sporadically?
One reason that primary care physicians 
might be unwilling to provide nutrition and diet counseling to their patients might be a lack of knowledge about how to provide these nutrition interventions. Food interventions can help patients manage their chronic diet-related diseases, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension, yet training in how to provide these interventions is not required in many medical schools across the country.
1008,1009,1010 Since the 1980s, the 
National Research Council has recommended that medical school curricula include at least twenty-five hours of nutrition education.
1011 Yet, 
in a 2012 survey of more than 100 medical 
schools in the United States appearing in the Journal of Biomedical Education , only 2 9 
percent of the schools reported providing the recommended 25 hours of nutrition education, and only 18 percent required a dedicated nutrition course in their curriculum.
1012
Furthermore, the Association of American Medical Colleges does not incorporate nutrition among its core competencies for medical students.
1013,1014 Many doctors are 
therefore left to figure out the symptoms and treatments of diet-related issues without the appropriate training.
1015
This issue expands outside of the United States as well: A systematic review of nutrition education in medical programs around the world appearing in The Lancet concluded that 
“nutrition is insufficiently incorporated into medical education, regardless of co untry, setting, or year of medical education.”
1016 As a 
result of this minimal training, medical students across the globe lack the “knowledge, skills, and confidence” to successfully incorporate nutrition into their practice,
1017 and very few 
doctors refer patients to dietitians even when their diagnosis is connected to nutrition.
1018
Thus, many patients, even among those who visit their doctor, do not receive nutrition education
1019 and lack both access to1020
as well as insurance reimbursement1021 for 
additional appointments. 
Many medical students recognize the 
importance of nutrition in health, even if they are not required to take a course about nutrition in medical school. In a 2019 survey
of third-year medical students at the Medical University of South Carolina appearing in the Journal of the American College of Nutrition , most students  responded that 
talking about nutrition and diet with patients was important.
1022 Forty-three percent 
of respondents said that they provided nutrition counseling even without any formal education in their school curriculum on the topic.
1023 Further investing in medical school 
nutrition curricula will instill the knowledge, skills, and confidence necessary for medical professionals to provide more effective treatment through informed diet counseling and nutrition education.
1024 Diet counseling 102   PART II  Food as Medicine Challenges   PART II  Food as Medicine Challenges   103from physicians will also help patients interpret 
all of the nutritional information they are likely to find online and on social media, improving their overall nutrition literacy.
1025
Some physicians and medical schools have begun incorporating “culinary medicine” into their practice.
1026,1027 Culinary medicine 
is a field that combines nutrition education, individual medical needs, and practical education about food preparation and cooking.
1028,1029 Culinary medicine programs 
have been proven effective at improving the knowledge and confidence of medical students as they become doctors.
1030,1031,1032
[More information about culinary medicine can be found in Part 3]. However, since not all medical schools incorporate culinary medicine into their curriculums as elaborated above, many patients are still left with little in the way of nutrition education from their primary care providers.
1033
Furthermore, while many patients will attempt to improve their diets when counseled by a physician,
1034 doctors need to be cautious not 
to stigmatize their patients and make them feel “fat shamed.”
1035 As medical student 
Triya Chakravorty wrote in the BMJ, “[i]n a 
health care setting, negative attitudes held by healthcare professionals will make patients feel stigmatised and reluctant to access health care services, further damaging their long term health.”
1036 To better serve patients of all sizes, 
healthcare professionals should be trained in techniques to talk about weight with patients without shame or judgment.
1037
Medical school curricula have been developed historically, focusing on biology, behavior, and disease rather than more inclusive approaches that include nutrition education. Emily M. Broad Leib, the Director of the Food Law and 
Policy Clinic  of the Center for Health Law 
and Policy Innovation  at Harvard University, 
toldThe Counter , “because [nutrition] wasn’t 
prioritized for so long, there aren’t a lot of faculty and medical schools that have any knowledge about nutrition and diet. To build it into schools now requires real investment in hiring and training.”
1038 In her analysis of 
food as medicine in medical programs, Sarah Downer, a clinical instructor at Harvard’s Center for Health Law and Policy Innovation, writes: 
Theories for the lack of progress include 
lack of leadership or faculty level nutrition champions at many medical schools, lack of compelling training opportunities (such as fellowships) focused on nutrition, and rapidly advancing nutrition science coupled with rampant public nutrition misinformation might have minimised the perceived credibility of nutrition science among physicians.
1039
In a Harvard Law School Food Law and Policy 
Clinic report, “ Doctoring Our Diet: Policy 
Tools to Include Nutrition in U.S. Medical Training ,” the authors note that “[t]he lack 
of comprehensive nutrition education for physicians represents a missed opportunity for doctors to promote good health, illness prevention, and treatment of chronic diseases.”
1040
Additionally, requiring comprehensive nutrition training as a component of healthcare clinician education will ensure equitable patient access to nutrition expertise no matter their geographic location or the type of doctor they are seeing. Ways to ensure the incorporation of nutrition into medical education curricula include legislative mandates, making government funding for schools contingent upon inclusion of nutrition courses; integration of nutrition coursework into accreditation standards; and the inclusion of nutrition questions on board and other qualifying examinations.
1041
“Doctoring Our Diet: Policy Tools to Include Nutrition in U.S. Medical Training” also includes numerous recommendations for educators at both the undergraduate and graduate levels in order to best improve the quality of nutrition education medical professionals receive, thus improving the quality of nutrition counseling they provide to their patients. Recommendations include:
●Amend the American Council of Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) accreditation requirements to include nutrition education.
●Tie government funds for residency programs to the inclusion of nutrition education.●Include nutrition in state continuing medical 
education requirements.
●Include nutrition in continuing education requirements for federally-employed doctors.
1042
Executing these changes will empower future and practicing physicians to recognize the relationships between food, diet, and health and provide up-to-date evidence-based advice on eating habits, preventive health and disease management, all of which will help optimize health outcomes for patients. 
How Marketing and Legalized Health Claims 
Obfuscate the Impact of Food on Disease 
Front-of-package (FOP) food claims and 
descriptive key words and phrases are frequently used in food marketing and often create confusion among consumers.
1043,1044
These claims influence consumer decision making for both consumers with high nutritional knowledge and health motivation and those without.
1045 Consumers’ 
understanding of these types of claims is relevant to food as medicine because it sheds light on some of the most accessible health and nutrition information consumers receive: marketing. Furthermore, FDA-approved health claims in particular demonstrate what the average consumer is likely to believe about the relationship between diet and disease,
1046
because these claims are so pervasive in everyday life.
1047
There are three types of claims that can be used by food companies: health claims, nutrient content claims, and structure/function claims.Health Claims
A health claim is defined by the FDA as having two components: “(1) a substance (whether a food, food component, or dietary ingredient) and (2) a disease or health-related condition.”
1048 If a statement does not have 
these two things, then it is not considered a health claim, and is therefore not subject to premarket review and authorization from the FDA.
1049 There are two different types of 
health claims: authorized and qualified (see related Spotlights).
Many players in the food industry have 
attached health claims to their products for decades. In 1886, Coca-Cola was sold as a patented medicine and “brain tonic”; Dr. Pepper was also advertised as a “brain tonic” in drugstores.
1050,1051 As recently as 
2013, Coca-Cola released advertisements promoting Coke products as part of a healthy lifestyle working to combat obesity.
1052 Other 
advertisements from Coca-Cola promised to cure headaches and relieve mental and physical exhaustion.
1053 Kellogg’s is another 104   PART II  Food as Medicine Challenges   PART II  Food as Medicine Challenges   105Spotlight: Qualified Health Claims
Qualified health claims, which are supported by scientific evidence but do not meet the 
significant scientific agreement standard required for the FDA to approve an authorized claim, are also a frequently used marketing strategy.
1054,1055 In order to ensure that these 
claims are not false or misleading to consumers, they must be accompanied by disclaimers or additional language to accurately communicate the level of scientific evidence supporting them.
1056 These disclaimers include phrases such as “supportive 
but not conclusive,” “very limited and preliminary scientific research,” “scientific evidence suggests but does not prove” or “limited scientific evidence.”
1057 Including these phrases 
that are not accepted by the FDA as an authorized claim can confuse consumers, as they are left not knowing what to believe about how their diet will affect their health.
1058
An example of a qualified health claim that has been approved by the FDA: “Supportive but not conclusive research shows that eating 1.5 ounces per day of walnuts, as part of a low saturated fat and low cholesterol diet and not resulting in increased caloric intake, may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease.”
1059 There are dozens of 
similar qualified health claims that have been approved by the FDA.
1060 
These include statements about tomatoes and cancer,
1061,1062 nuts and 
coronary heart disease,1063,1064,1065 
psyllium husk and diabetes,1066 
cranberries and urinary tract infections,
1067 and more. 
Spotlight: Authorized Health Claims
Also called “significant scientific agreement” health claims, authorized health claims 
connect specific molecules and nutrients with specific diseases and disease states. They require a rigorous standard of agreement among qualified experts in order to be used.
1068 This “significant scientific agreement” is determined by the FDA, which 
considers “the totality of the publicly available scientific evidence (including evidence from well-designed studies conducted in a manner that is consistent with generally recognized scientific procedures and principles).”
1069 Since 1990, when the Nutrition 
Labeling and Education Act was passed and the FDA was made to regulate health claims, 12 health claims have been authorized for use.
1070
While none of these claims have been revoked by the FDA yet, one claim has been challenged: the claim that soy protein reduces risk of heart disease.
1071 A rule has been 
proposed to revoke this authorization, as it no longer meets the substantial scientific agreement requirement.
1072 There have been calls for more research into soy protein to 
have evidence upon which to base a soy protein food health claim.1073
Health claims of this type can also be made as an “authoritative statement” of a scientific body.
1074 The scientific bodies that can make these authoritative statements include 
the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the National Academy of Sciences.
1075 There are currently two authorized 
health claims based on authoritative statements.1076,1077
Some examples of a model authorized health claim, according to the Code of Federal Regulations: 
● “Adequate calcium throughout life, as part of a well-balanced diet, may reduce the 
risk of osteoporosis.”1078 
● “Eating a healthful diet low in fat may help reduce the risk of some types of cancers.”
1079
● “Diets low in sodium may reduce the risk of high blood pressure, a disease associated with many factors.”
1080
● “Diets low in saturated fat, cholesterol, and total fat may reduce the risk of heart disease. Heart disease is dependent upon many factors, including diet, a family history of the disease, elevated blood LDL-cholesterol levels, and physical inactivity.”
1081
● “Low fat diets rich in fiber-containing grain products, fruits, and vegetables may reduce the risk of some types of cancer, a disease associated with many factors.”
1082
Note that these types of health claims include the word “may” or “might.”1083106   PART II  Food as Medicine Challenges   PART II  Food as Medicine Challenges   107company with a history of making medicinal 
claims about its products; in fact, the founder, John Kellogg, MD, started by serving medicinal cereals and granolas to a health institution.
1084,1085 Most recently, through its 
acquired brand, Insurgent Brands, makers of famed RXBar, it introduced RX Cereal as an attempt to rebrand itself under the “clean” and “healthy” food labels.
1086 The cereals are made 
with “plant-based protein” using “a mix of pea protein, almonds and brown rice to provide its protein.”
1087
Nutrient Content Claims
Another strategy commonly used by food marketers is nutrient content claims , which 
tell consumers about certain nutrients that are in the food.
1088 Any claims about the levels of 
nutrients in food that are not on the nutrition information panel are considered nutrient content claims, and most are regulated by the FDA.
1089,1090,1091
There are two types of nutrient content claims: express and implied.
1092 Express nutrient 
content claims are direct statements about the nutrient levels in food.
1093,1094 This includes 
terms and phrases such as “high in...,” “light/lite,” and calorie counts, among others.
1095
Implied nutrient content claims, however, only suggest the presence or absence of certain nutrients.
1096 This includes claims such as 
“high in oat bran” (oat bran is not a nutrient, but the presence of this ingredient suggests the presence of dietary fiber to the consumer) and “contains the same amount of [the nutrient] as [other food].”
1097
These are particularly powerful at influencing consumers’ beliefs about the “healthiness” of foods. In a 2018 study of nutrient content claims on snack foods, researchers found that consumers perceived foods with nutrient content claims to have healthful attributes, and consumers were more likely to purchase those foods.
1098Structure/Function Claims
Structure/function claims  are statements that 
describe how a given nutrient or ingredient in the food affects or maintains the structure or function of the human body.
1099 “Calcium 
builds strong bones” is a prime example of a structure/function claim.
1100 These are perhaps 
better known for being used on dietary supplements, but are used on conventional foods as well.
1101 Structure/function claims on 
food must relate to the food’s nutritive effects, whereas on dietary supplements they can relate to non-nutritive effects as well.
1102,1103
These claims must be truthful and not misleading; however, they are not subject to premarket approval from the FDA before they are used.
1104
These types of claims received scrutiny in 2016, particularly the use of them on infant formula packaging.
1105 This led the FDA to 
issue draft guidance on how marketers can use structure/function claims on infant formula labels in September 2016.
1106 While this 
guidance does not have the force of law, it was the first time that the FDA shared its thinking about structure/function claims for a food product specifically.
1107,1108 Clearly there is plenty of room for the FDA to better regulate the use of these claims in foods; as researcher John C. Wallingford wrote in Advances in 
Nutrition  in 2018, “Consistent standards can 
ensure that [structure/function] claims across food types are truthful and not misleading, and protect consumers’ access to new scientific learnings about the functions of substances in foods.”
1109
Use of Unregulated and 
Misleading Health-Related Terms
Terms such as “natural” can be found all over 
products on supermarket shelves. However, these labels are not regulated and consumers are often unaware of what they actually mean.
1110 The FDA has not established a 
formal definition for the term “natural.”1111,1112 ,1113
Addressing the term, the FDA wrote:
The FDA has considered the term “natural” 
to mean that nothing artificial or synthetic (including all color additives regardless of source) has been included in, or has been added to, a food that would not normally be expected to be in that food. However, this policy was not intended to address food production methods, such as the use of pesticides, nor did it explicitly address food processing or manufacturing methods, such as thermal technologies, pasteurization, or irradiation. The FDA also did not consider whether the term “natural” should describe any nutritional or other health benefit.
1114
Meanwhile, the USDA defines the term 
“natural” as products “containing no artificial ingredients or added colors” and “is only minimally processed,” meaning it is “processed in a manner that does not fundamentally alter the product.”
1115 The lack of guidelines and 
loose definitions mean that animals raised with hormones and antibiotics can still be labeled “natural,” as can Cheetos, lemon-flavored Oreos, and Skippy peanut butter.
1116
There’s ample evidence to demonstrate that big food companies profit from confusion among consumers. A Consumer Reports 
survey found that 73 percent of respondents purchased products labeled “natural”—a greater number than those who purchased foods with the stricter “organic” label.
1117 And 
108   PART II  Food as Medicine Challenges   PART II  Food as Medicine Challenges   109another survey performed by Technomic, a 
foodservice consulting company, found that one in five consumers are willing to pay more for products labeled “natural” and “organic.”
1118
A study published  in the journal Nutrients in 
2021 found that many consumers feel that food products containing the claim “natural” or the “organic” label are superior to food without these claims or labels, even if the product is a chip or cookie.
1119 These feelings could 
arise from the manner the food was grown or produced, or the health benefits of food that may not be man-made.
1120 This effect is 
commonly called a “health halo.”1121,1122,1123
In one 2015 study published in Psychology 
& Marketing, researchers found that the presence of a health halo (in this case, the word “organic”) reduced negative consumer perceptions of food products that otherwise had no nutritional information
1124 (note that the 
USDA has strict requirements for use of the word “organic” on food labels).
1125,1126 Absent any specific information about the nutritional content of foods, perceived health terms on package labeling improves consumers’ perceptions of the quality and healthiness of the product.
1127 Given the previously 
mentioned Consumer Reports  survey,1128 it is 
possible that the unregulated word “natural” might have a similar health halo effect.
1129 In 
fact, the health halo effect has been found even for products made by companies with reputations as being socially responsible—a characteristic that seemingly has nothing to do with the nutritional quality of the food.
1130
Using “natural flavors” also has proved to be a lucrative marketing tool for many food manufacturers.
1131,1132 Unlike “natural,” 
however, the FDA does have a definition for the phrase “natural flavor”: 
The term natural flavor or natural flavoring 
means the essential oil, oleoresin, essence or extractive, protein hydrolysate, distillate, 
or any product of roasting, heating or enzymolysis, which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juice, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible yeast, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or similar plant material, meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products thereof, whose significant function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional.
1133
However, many of these natural flavors 
undergo intensive chemical processing before they are used, making the distinction between which flavors are “natural” or “artificial” murky and difficult for consumers to understand.
1134,1135 As with artificial flavorings, 
“natural” flavorings are created in a lab, often with the addition of preservatives and emulsifiers; once a team of professional “flavorists” is done extracting and distilling a natural flavor from a plant or animal, it has the same chemical composition as a synthetic artificial flavor.
1136,1137
The lack of strict regulation concerning the use of the term “all natural” by the FDA has kept litigation between consumers and food companies prevalent,
1138 as consumers are 
often left feeling misled.1139,1140 Lawsuits such 
as these often have a secondary purpose, which is to put pressure on the FDA to regulate “natural,” either by creating guidelines for when the word can be used or by banning use of it altogether.
1141,1142,1143 For example, a 
2016 class-action lawsuit  against Kind LLC 
(ie, Kind Bars) accused the brand of using the phrases “all natural” and “non-GMO” despite the snack foods containing genetically-modified and highly processed ingredients.
1144
The lawsuit was put on hold in 2018 pending guidance from the USDA or FDA regarding the definition of “natural,” but was allowed to proceed once again in early 2019 due to a lack of movement on the part of the government.
1145
The case was certified in 2021,1146,1147 but has 
yet to be decided as of publication. Dr. Marion Nestle, PhD, Paulette Goddard Professor of Nutrition, Food Studies, and Public Health, Emerita, at New York University, has done extensive research on food labeling practices and the way food marketers use labels to mislead consumers. On her website, Food Politics , Dr. Nestle frequently writes 
about the efforts made by these marketers to advertise their products as “natural” or “healthy.”
1148,1149,1150,1151 While “healthy” does, 
technically, have a definition according to the FDA, it is a broad definition: the term can be used when food products “(1) Are not low in total fat, but have a fat profile makeup of predominantly mono and polyunsaturated fats; or (2) contain at least ten percent of the Daily Value (DV) per reference amount customarily consumed (RACC) of potassium or vitamin D.”
1152 According to Dr. Nestle, “natural” and 
“healthy” are “about marketing, not health.”1153
The “natural” label is not the only one to go largely unregulated.
1154 Terms like 
“lightly sweetened,” “made with real...,” and “multigrain” also lack official definitions, leaving customers vulnerable to overinterpreting the nutritional value of products carrying these labels.
1155 Additionally, the terms “superfood” 
and “miracle food” can misinform the public 110   PART II  Food as Medicine Challenges   PART II  Food as Medicine Challenges   111by implying to consumers that one specific 
“superfood” is able to provide all the nutrients they need for health,
1156 these are also 
unregulated terms.1157 Studies used to back 
“superfood” claims are often sponsored by the companies and organizations representing the foods they wish to promote.
1158 The term 
“superfood” influences consumer behaviors and their value judgements when making food choices at the grocery store, as it convinces consumers that certain foods have more value than others.
1159 This marketing tactic does 
not have to even be directly used by the food company selling the product; media coverage and informal marketing communication usage of the term also influences consumer behavior.
1160 In fact, scientists researching 
the health benefits of these so-called “superfoods” frequently use the term in their academic publications.
1161,1162
Another way food marketers imply that a product may improve consumers’ health is by drawing attention to recipe changes.
1163
Companies often advertise foods as “reduced sodium” or “reduced calorie” in hopes of attracting diet-conscious customers; however, the “reduced” claim is only a comparison to the product’s original formulation.
1164 These 
claims do not specify the nutrient content of the original item, meaning that a manufacturer could label a food product as “reduced sodium” even if its salt levels far exceed the recommended daily allowance.
1165
“Healthy” Beverages
The past twenty years have seen a surge in the production and sales of functional beverages that promise health benefits to consumers.
1166 These include beverages 
such as kombucha, kefir, energy drinks, and vegetable juices.
1167 Food companies 
capitalize off the perceived health benefits of these drinks in order to target marketing more effectively toward people whose health values have shifted away from sugar-sweetened beverages.
1168 The marketplace is now filled 
with probiotic drinks, mushroom-infused teas and beers, and beverages containing trendy wellness ingredients such as nootropics and adaptogens.
1169
One of the most popular types of functional beverages is those which are fermented, such as kombucha and kefir,
1170,1171,1172 many of 
which have been produced and consumed by cultures around the globe for centuries.
1173,1174
These types of beverages are popular in part due to the presence of pre- and probiotics, which can be beneficial for gut health.
1175
Kombucha in particular has seen immense growth in popularity.
1176 The kombucha market 
was worth more than $1.5 billion in 2019, and is expected to grow to at least triple that by 2027.
1177,1178 International beverage 
companies, such as PepsiCo and Coca-Cola, have purchased commercial kombucha companies to capitalize off this consumer interest.
1179,1180
Sports and energy drinks, designed to help athletes hydrate and recover after physical exertion, are also popular among the non-athlete population, particularly adolescents.
1181,1182 The beneficial attributes 
of these beverages for athletic performance is well-established, but it is unclear how beneficial they are for people not performing strenuous physical exercise.
1183 Companies 
producing these drinks can be expected to continue selling them to a larger audience, as the sports drink market is projected to continue growing in the coming years.
1184
112   PART II  Food as Medicine Challenges   PART II  Food as Medicine Challenges   113Food Industry-Funded Research
Food industry leaders, including both 
corporations and agricultural boards, have long provided funding to scholars and organizations researching the nutritional benefits of various foods.
1185,1186, This funding 
might, of course, contribute to bias in the results of nutrition studies,
1187,1188 which then 
can skew dietary guidelines and the foods that consumers choose based on perceived healthfulness.
1189 Furthermore, the money 
invested into research by these industry players shapes the research agenda and determines which nutritional topics are investigated.
1190 There are many groups 
funding research, including large corporations (such as Coca-Cola
1191), trade associations 
(such as the National Confectioners Association
1192) and agricultural boards (such 
as the Hass Avocado Board1193).
On her website, Food Politics,1194 Dr. 
Marion Nestle has long advised consumers to be skeptical of industry-funded research.
1195,1196,1197,1198,1199 Every week she 
highlights a recent food study that is either fully or partially funded by a figure or organization with a stake in the food item being researched. For example, Dr. Nestle highlighted  the 
funding of a 2018 study between breakfast 
consumption and body weight funded by a leading global breakfast cereal company Cereal Partners Worldwide, a partnership with Nestlé and General Mills.
1200 Dr. Nestle wrote 
of the study’s “predictable results,” which concluded that regular breakfast consumption (such as a bowl of cereal) was associated with healthier body weight.
1201
In addition to “Big Food,” agricultural boards are frequent funders of food research.
1202,1203 In 
recent years, the Almond Board of California has funded two studies, one in Phytotherapy 
Research  in 2019 and another  in Nutrients
in 2021, assessing the impact of almond consumption on wrinkles.1204,1205 I n both 
studies, researchers compared before-and-after photographs to analyze changes to wrinkle severity among groups of menopausal women who replaced 20 percent of their daily caloric intake with almonds over a 16 week period.
1206,1207 Despite the small sample size 
and brief study period, researchers concluded that regular almond consumption may reduce signs of photoaging.
1208,1209 Dr. Nestle 
featured the articles, and the media coverage surrounding them, on her Food Politics blog in September 2021.
1210
In 2021, Dr. Nestle wrote about another studyfunded by an agricultural board: a study from The Journal of Nutrition partially funded 
by the Hass Avocado Board.
1211 The study 
determined that daily avocado consumption may lead to an improved gut microbiome.
1212
However, Dr. Nestle noted that the positive effects attributed to avocados in this study could apply to other foods.
1213 She writes:
All fruits and vegetables provide nutritional 
value, and the best way to get the nutrients you need is by eating a variety of them. If you like avocados, include them in that variety. If not, don’t. 
The Haas marketers want you to think that 
avocados are a superfood. Alas, there is no such thing. All fruits and vegetables provide nutritional value. By that criterion, all fruits and vegetables are superfoods.
1214
“Big Soda” (a term used by many activists 
to describe the soda industry), notably Coca-Cola, is a known funder of health organizations and nutrition research around the globe.
1215,1216,1217,1218,1219,1220 In 2015, AP 
reported on leaked emails that revealed  Coca-
Cola had input in the research and strategy development of the Global Energy Balance Network (GEBN), a nonprofit dedicated to 
114   PART II  Food as Medicine Challenges   PART II  Food as Medicine Challenges   115fighting obesity.1221,1222,1223 The GEBN’s major 
arguments included claims that consumption 
of sugar-sweetened beverages is not linked to obesity.
1224 Coca-Cola was also found to have 
some influence over researchers studying childhood obesity by funding their work,
1225 and 
from 2011 until 2015, the company attempted to convince the CDC and the World Health Organization to promote exercise (rather than diet) as a solution to obesity.
1226,1227 Coca-Cola 
is not the only major beverage group to use funding as an attempt to sway research; soda giant PepsiCo and the American Beverage Association, a lobbying group, have also funded studies that did not find a correlation between consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and obesity.
1228,1229,1230
More broadly, the sugar industry’s funding of nutrition research has a long history; publications from as far back as the 1960s that skewed evidence about the cause of coronary heart disease have had sugar industry funding.
1231,1232 “[I]t was unfortunate 
that these papers were published because they influenced the public discussion about the health impact of sugar,” said Michael Jacobson, PhD, co-founder and former long-term Executive Director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, in an interview
on National Public Radio.
1233
Gary Sacks, PhD, a fellow at the Global Obesity Centre, Institute for Health Transformation, School of Health and Social Development, and faculty member of Health at Deakin University, in Australia and his colleagues reviewed  the 10 most-
cited “nutrition and dietetics-related journals” in 2018 for the journal PLoS ONE.  The 
researchers found that 13.4 percent of studies on nutrition published in the leading nutrition journals featured involvement from the food industry, either through funding, affiliation, or other connections.
1234 Furthermore, the 
study revealed that more than 55 percent of research findings from articles with food industry involvement reported food industry-favorable results as compared to articles not backed by the food industry.
1235
Of note, some question whether peer-reviewed journals should deny publications funded by industry. For example, thirty percent of the studies published in The Journal of 
Nutrition  (JN) in 2018 had industry funding.
1236
When asked by Scientific American  about this, 
JN’s editor-in-chief, Teresa Davis, said, “I think it’s not appropriate for us to discriminate based on the institution the manuscript is submitted from, or the funding source, or the country.”
1237
She also added that, due to lack of financial support from other sources (including the government), researchers often have no other options to fund their work.
1238
Industry influence over research agendas causes a narrowing of the topics that are studied in peer-reviewed journals.
1239,1240 “The 
influence on the research agenda might allow the food industry to narrowly frame public health problems and policy solutions as needing technological intervention rather than behavioural or system-wide interventions,” wrote researchers Alice Fabbri, Taylor J. Holland, and Lisa A. Bero in an analysis  for 
Public Health Nutrition  published in 2018.
1241
This influences the kind of information available to the public and to policymakers seeking solutions to public health problems, and corporate interests are not always aligned with the health needs of the people.
1242And according to Dr. Sacks and colleagues, writing  in PLoS One in 2020:
There are many reasons why food 
companies might be involved in nutrition-related research. These reasons may include unobjectionable motives such as a willingness to develop new knowledge, assist in research translation and contribute expertise and resources.
1243
However, from a public health perspective, several concerns have been identified regarding food industry involvement in research. These include: 1) the creation of increased marketing opportunities for industry products, many of which are harmful to population health;
1244
2) the establishment and nurturing of relationships between the food industry and nutrition researchers that serves to increase perceived industry credibility, reduce industry criticism, and encourage increased dependency on the food industry;
1245,1246 3) industry influence 
over research agendas to preferentially focus on topics likely to benefit industry interests, rather than topics of public health importance;
1247 4) industry influence on 
the methods, conclusions and impact of research in ways that are likely to favour industry interests over and above other factors;
1248,1249,1250,1251 and 5) use 
of research for political purposes.1252,1253
An increased dependence on food industry funding by academics has been documented,
1254,1255,1256,1257 with food 
industry funding sometimes acknowledged as a strategically important funding source for the university sector.

Food as Medicine: 
Interventions, Programs, Policies and Practices
The global epidemic of diet-related diseases 
has led to the increased use of food as medicine as a way to treat these illnesses and avoid costly healthcare.
1260,1261 Food 
as medicine, however, is not a specific treatment; rather, there are a variety of different food interventions that have been used to help prevent, treat, or co-treat disease.
1262 Some of the most widespread 
forms of food interventions include medically tailored meals (meals specially designed and prepared for people based on their medical conditions) and food prescriptions (foods assigned by a doctor or health care professional for treatment, co-treatment, or prevention of a disease). Incorporating these solutions directly into programs such as Medicare and Medicaid has proven to be an affordable and effective solution, improving health outcomes and reducing healthcare costs.
1263,1264,1265,1266,1267,1268,1269,1270 A 2019 microsimulation  of Medicare and Medicaid 
food interventions, conducted by researchers from Tufts University and published in PLoS 
ONE, found th at “[e]conomic incentives for healthier foods through Medicare and Medicaid could generate substantial health gains and be highly cost-effective.”
1271 The 
microsimulation determined that offering subsidies for fruits, vegetables, and other select “healthful foods,” could save $100 billion in healthcare costs over the lifetime (average lifetime of a Medicare or Medicaid user is 18.3 years) of all Medicare and Medicaid participants from 2009-2014 (82 million adults).
1272 The following section provides an 
overview of key types of food as medicine interventions, programs, and practices, while spotlighting examples of programs and policies in action.Food as Medicine Interventions 
Medically Tailored Meals (MTMs)
Many people living with chronic disease seek dietary changes to help them manage their health,
1273,1274,1275 but often these patients 
face a variety of barriers such as cost, food insecurity, lack of food proximity, physical disability, and a lack of educational resources about food as treatment or co-treatment.
1276,1277
Medically tailored meals (MTMs) are a food as medicine intervention that can help overcome some of these barriers, including cost and mobility, through directly providing meals to people living with chronic conditions.
1278,1279
Patients in medically tailored meal programs are provided with meals (oftentimes through delivery)  that are individually tailored to their health conditions, medications, and other dietary needs.
1280
There has been extensive research published about the health effects of MTM programs.
1281,1282,1283,1284 In 2018, Boston-based 
MTM provider Community Servings supported a clinical trial  appearing in the Journal of 
General Internal Medicine  of 44 food insecure 
adults living with type 2 diabetes, providing participants with home-delivered  MTMs for 12 weeks.
1285 In this trial, participants 
reported lower rates of food insecurity and improved Healthy Eating Index scores while receiving meals.
1286 In a 2016 randomized 
controlled trial  appearing in the Journal of 
Clinical Oncology  evaluating the impact of 
home-delivered MTMs  provided by the New York City-based God’s Love We Deliver to 180 patients with cancer, participants self-reported higher Quality of Life scores after 12 weeks in the program.
1287 Furthermore, in 
a 2018 study published in Health Affairs of 
diabetes patients experiencing food insecurity, researc hers found that emergency room visits were less frequent among those participating in a MTM delivery program compared to patients participating in a non-tailored meal delivery program.
1288
Other studies have found connections between participation in MTM programs and reduced health care costs.
1289 MANNA, an 
organization that provides MTMs to people at nutritional risk as a result of managing serious illness in Pennsylvania and New Jersey,
1290
conducted a 2013 study published in the 
Journal of Primary Care & Community Health of the relationship between its MTM program and healthcare costs. 
1291 The researchers 
found that healthcare costs for each participant were reduced by an average of $10,754 per month in the first three months of receiving services from MANNA.
1292 In another 
study conducted by Community Servings and published in JAMA Internal Medicine  in 2019,  
MTM recipients saw a 16 percent decrease in healthcare costs and fewer inpatient or skilled nursing facility admissions compared to the control group, who did not receive meals from Community Servings.
1293
MTMs are provided to patients from a variety of sources, including through the work of nonprofits such as God’s Love We Deliver, in New York City,
1294 Community Servings, 
in Boston,1295 and Project Open Hand, in 
San Francisco.1296 Furthermore, numerous 
public and private health insurers (such as New York’s Amida Care,
1297 North Carolina 
Medicaid,1298 and California’s Medi-Cal1299) 
now offer coverage for MTMs. There is mounting evidence that dietary interventions such as MTMs improve patient health outcomes,
1300,1301,1302,1303 reducing the need 
for expensive treatments and thus reducing costs for both patients and health insurance companies.
1304120   PART III  Food as Medicine: Interventions, Programs, Policies and Practices   PART III  Food as Medicine: Interventions, Programs, Policies and Practices   121For uninsured individuals or those whose 
insurance does not cover MTM programs, some MTM providers provide meals free of charge, such as Community Servings
1305 and 
God’s Love We Deliver.1306
Studies have shown MTMs to have a particularly beneficial impact on patients experiencing poverty and food insecurity.
1307,1308 David Waters, CEO of 
Community Servings, said of clients in an interview  with Tom Lee for the journal NEJM 
Catalyst: “They are hungry, they are poor, and, most importantly, they’re very isolated by their illness—unable to walk to the store, carry a bag of groceries, or stand at the stove.”
1309
According to a 2018 clinical trial  published 
in the Journal of General Internal Medicine , 
“A healthy diet is the cornerstone of diabetes management, but food insecurity incents the consumption of inexpensive, calorie-dense food of little nutritional value.”
1310 All 
of the participants included in the study were experiencing food insecurity; by the end of the trial, 62% of participants reported experiencing food insecurity when not receiving MTMs, whereas only 42% reporting experiencing food insecurity while receiving MTMs.
1311
Another study appearing in the Journal 
of Urban Health  that provided MTMs to 
individuals with diabetes or HIV in the San Francisco found that the intervention reduced very low food security from 60 percent to 12 pe rcent among participants.
1312 Participants 
in the study were given healthy meals and snacks designed to provide 100 percent of their daily nutritional needs and energy requirements. After 6 months, MTM recipients ate less fat and sugar and more fruits and vegetables, they binge-drank less, and felt less distressed and more in control of their diabetes.
It is important to note, however, that much of 
the research regarding MTMs is funded by the organizations providing these services, such as Community Servings,
1313,1314,1315,1316,1317
Project Open Hand in San Francisco,1318,1319
and Project Angel Heart in Denver.1320
While the financial support of these organizations, might result in sponsorship bias in the research findings,
1321 the importance 
of these studies is not to be underestimated. Further research is needed to reinforce the outcomes and findings already published. Additional studies supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), health insurance organizations, policy organizations, and third-party research departments—whether academic or clinical—are crucial to future understanding of the impact and thus widespread implementation of MTMs.
1322
The work and research done by community based organizations (i.e. medically tailored meal programs) have laid the groundwork for demonstrating the positive impact of treating and preventing chronic disease states with meals. In a 2021 food as medicine panel hosted by the University of Pennsylvania’s Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics, panelist Sarah Downer, JD, Associate Director of Harvard Law School’s Center for Health Law and Policy Innovation, said, “We need 
the NIH to really get in the game with funding research on this... and the government is best positioned to do the kind of big investment in preventive long-term studies that we would like to see.”
1323
Fruit and Vegetable 
Prescription Programs
Produce prescription programs are healthcare 
interventions wherein doctors or other health care providers (e.g. registered dietitians, pharmacists) “prescribe” certain foods (mostly fruits and vegetables) to help targeted patient populations prevent or manage chronic disease, much like they might prescribe a pharmaceutical drug.
1324,1325 Produce 
122   PART III  Food as Medicine: Interventions, Programs, Policies and Practices   PART III  Food as Medicine: Interventions, Programs, Policies and Practices   123
prescription programs go by a variety of 
names and are also known as “Pharmacy to Farm,” “Food Prescriptions,” “Fresh Rx,” “ProduceRx,” “Fresh Food Farmacy,” “ Farmacy,” “Fruit and Vegetable Prescription Programs,” “Harvest RX,” ”Veggies as Medicine,” “SuperSNAP,” or “VeggieRx.”
According to the National Produce Prescription 
Collaborative, a produce prescription program is defined as “A medical treatment or preventative service for patients who are eligible due to diet-related health risk or condition, food insecurity or other documented challenges in access to nutritious foods, and are referred by a healthcare provider or health insurance plan. These prescriptions are fulfilled through food retail and enable patients to access healthy produce with no added fats, sugars, or salt, at low or no cost to the patient.”
1326
Produce prescription programs provide a financial incentive (e.g. discount, bonus, or credit) to increase access to and consumption of fresh fruits in vegetables among targeted patient populations, which in turn may have an impact on diet-related health outcomes.
1327
Research has demonstrated that produce prescription programs may also be an effective healthcare intervention to reduce food insecurity among patients.
1328,1329,1330,1331 In a 
2021 study published in the Archives of Public 
Health , the authors highlight the important 
impact produce prescription interventions can have on food insecurity and health: “Food insecurity is associated with poor nutritional health outcomes. Prescribing fresh fruits and vegetables in healthcare settings may be an opportunity to link patients with community support to promote healthy diets and improve food security.”
1332
Federal support for nutrition incentive programs was introduced in the 2014 Farm Bill which authorized the Food Insecurity Nutrition Incentive (FINI) program. This program provided $100 million to fund programs that provided incentives to increase 
the purchase of fruits and vegetables by low-
income consumers.1333 In the 2018 Farm Bill, 
FINI was expanded and renamed the Gus 
Schumacher Nutrition Incentive Program 
(GusNIP),1334 after Gus Schumacher , a 
longtime advocate for healthy food access for 
low-income households.1335 The 2018 
expansion explicitly earmarks funding and 
evaluation support for produce prescription 
programs.1336  The 2018 Farm Bill authorized up 
to $25 million in funding over five years for 
produce  prescription programs.1337
In 2019, Wholesome Wave , a nonprofit 
organization , founded by Gus Schumacher and 
Chef Michel Nischan,  that is often credited with 
pioneering one of the first produce prescription 
program,1338,1339 created the National Produce 
Prescription Collaborative .  The goal of the 
Collaborative is to catalyze the vital role of 
food and nutrition in improving health and 
wellness by collectively leveraging the unique 
opportunities for produce prescriptions to 
achieve wellness through the healthcare 
system, and embedding & institutionalizing 
Produce Prescriptions within the healthcare 
payment model.1340
Produce prescription programs have rapidly 
expanded across the United States over 
the past decade. In 2020, Wholesome 
Wave commissioned consulting firm DAISA 
Enterprises to conduct a field scan report of 
produce prescription programs in the United 
States between 2010 and 2020.1341 The report 
identified a total of 108 produce prescription 
programs across 38 states with nearly a 
quarter of all identified programs launched in 
2019 alone. 
Key components of produce prescription 
programs are discussed below and include: 
i) the identification of targeted patient

Identifying Targeted Patient 
Populations
Produce prescription programs are distinct in 
that they partner with health care providers or insurers to identify targeted patient populations who would benefit from increased access to and consumption of fruits and vegetables.
1342
Produce prescriptions are fulfilled through food retail and enable patients to access produce with no added fats, sugars, or salt, at low or no cost to the patient.
1343 According to the 
National Produce Prescription Collaborative, “when appropriately dosed, produce prescription programs are designed to improve healthcare outcomes, optimize medical spending, and increase patient engagement and satisfaction.”
1344
Health care providers who prescribe produce prescriptions can include physicians, nurses, pharmacists, registered dietitians, social workers, community health workers, and midwives.
1345 Patient eligibility for produce 
prescription programs is often based on the presence or risk of a diet-related health condition (such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity) and/or socioeconomic criteria such as food insecurity, insurance status and/or income.
1346 A detailed report of current 
produce prescription programs in the United States commissioned by Wholesome Wave found that 82 percent of  programs use diet-related chronic disease as part of eligibility criteria, with 31 percent specifically focused on diabetes.
1347
Examples of Produce Prescription 
Programs Targeting Patients With Diet-Related Chronic Diseases 
In 2020, Crossover Health Services in North 
Tulsa, Oklahoma, an under-resourced neighborhood lacking in places to buy fresh food, raised $180,000 to create Tulsa FreshRx.1348 The program is designed for 
patients with type 2 diabetes and provides participants with fresh fruits and vegetables every two weeks for one year in addition to lifestyle, nutrition, and cooking classes. The program aims to reduce diabete patients A1C levels (also known as the hemoglobin A1C or HbA1c test—is a simple blood test that measures your average blood sugar levels over the past 3 months
1349) by 1 to 2 percent 
over the course of a year which would equate to $16,000 to $24,000 in healthcare cost savings per person per year.
1350
Another program in Syracuse New York aims to mitigate chronic diabetes among patients who experience food insecurity. St. Joseph’s Health Food Pharmacy  offers type 2 diabetics 
enough fresh and healthy food for 2 meals a day, 5 times a week, for the patient and members of the household in addition to nutrition counseling and diabetes management group sessions.
1351 In order to participate in the 
program participants must have a diagnosis of diabetes with an A1C of 7.5 or higher and screen positive for food insecurity.
1352 “Food 
insecurity is a predictor of health and is linked to many chronic diseases,” explained St. Joseph’s Food Farmacy coordinator Deb Mendzef. “We are proud that we will be able to ensure that these patients, and their family members, have the resources necessary to provide a quality and healthy diet.”
1353
The Ohio-based produce prescription program, Health Improvement Partnership-Cuyahoga , is a community healthcare 
partnership that provides low-income patients managing hypertension with $40 in monthly farmers’ market produce vouchers and nutrition counseling at clinical visits.
1354,1355 In 
a 2018 study on the impact of this program, published in Preventing Chronic Disease , 
participants reported an increase in fruit and vegetable consumption, a decrease in fast food consumption, and improved communication with their health care providers about diet.
1356Examples of Produce Prescription 
Programs Utilizing Various Eligibility Criteria 
While the majority of produce prescription 
programs target patients with diet-related conditions, the program model may have utility for reaching broader populations of low-income patients.
1357 A review  published 
in the AMA Journal of Ethics explored the policy implications of produce prescription programs and noted that “Produce Rx programs that seek to enroll participants with low socioeconomic status (SES) could make greater use of existing public assistance systems through which incentives could be disbursed, such as Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Medicaid, thereby enlarging public data on the complex intersections between healthcare, food access, and income.” 
1358 The expansion of produce 
prescription eligibility requirements may play an important role in addressing broader social determinants of health that contribute to poor health outcomes in patients.
1359 Below are 
examples of produce prescription programs that utilize broader eligibility criteria in order to identify low-income populations who may benefit from increased access to and consumption of fruits and vegetables.
Operation Food Search, a hunger relief 
organization in St. Louis, Missouri, operates a program called Fresh RX: Nourishing Healthy 
Starts, that aims to enhance birth outcomes for food-insecure mothers and their infants. Fresh RX partners with Missouri Medicaid Health Plans to identify pregnant women who are experiencing food insecurity and provides them with weekly produce shares from a Combined Supported Agriculture Program (CSA) in addition to cooking classes, nutrition resources and supportive services during pregnancy.
1360 A 24 month pilot study with 75 
babies delivered in the St. Louis region found that a mother’s participation in the program improved food security by 44 percent and reduced the likelihood that her child would be born underweight from 16.3 percent to 11.0 percent, resulting in a savings of $189,000 in healthcare costs during the pilot.
1361 The 
program estimates that if results similar to the pilot could be achieved for all mothers in the St. Louis’s Medicaid system, an additional 118 babies would be born at a healthy weight and Missouri Medicaid would save approximately $5.3 million annually .
1362,1363 Trina Ragain, 
Director of Policy and Innovation at Operation Food Search noted that “Those savings come from what we know of what it costs when a low birth weight baby is born…they end up in neonatal intensive care, which is expensive.”
1364 In 2021, the program launched 
a three year randomized controlled trial with 750 women to formally evaluate the economic return on treating food insecurity among pregnant women.
1365
Other produce prescription programs have focused on reaching SNAP participants, as research suggests that SNAP benefits fall short of what households need to afford a healthy diet.
1366 Reinvestment Partners in 
North Carolina manages a statewide produce prescription program called SuperSNAP
where SNAP recipients are identified by health care providers and receive $40 per month to spend on fresh fruits and vegetables at over 500 Food Lion store locations across the state.
1367 A 2021 study published in JAMA 
Network Open  found that participation in the 
SuperSNAP program was associated with a significant increase in the purchase of fruits and vegetables of $31.84 per month and a decrease in the monthly spending on sugar sweetened beverages.
1368
The Washington State FVRx program partners with public and private healthcare systems to provide SNAP recipients with $10 grocery store vouchers that can be redeemed for fresh, canned, or frozen fruit or vegetables at over 169 participating supermarkets across the state.
1369 This statewide initiative 
strategically chose to implement the produce 126   PART III  Food as Medicine: Interventions, Programs, Policies and Practices   PART III  Food as Medicine: Interventions, Programs, Policies and Practices   127
of paper vouchers included ease of use across 
settings, minimal technology requirements and low costs. A limitation of paper vouchers reported by participants is that they may carry stigma or evoke self-consciousness that can impact participation.
1370
Some produce prescription programs are working directly with food retailers to leverage existing loyalty card programs to distribute monetary funds to participants to purchase produce, eliminating the need for vouchers. For example, Reinvestment Partners manages a statewide produce prescription program in North Carolina and partners with healthcare centers and over 500 Food Lion stores to provide SNAP recipients  with $40 per month loaded onto the store’s MVP loyalty card for the purchase of fruits and vegetables.
1371 Here 
is how the SuperSNAP program works1372:
●Step 1: The patient must enroll in the program at a participating healthcare center and provide their health care provider with their name, phone number and Food Lion MVP customer loyalty card number. If the patient does not have a Food Lion MVP customer loyalty card, their health care provider can help them sign up for one.
●Step 2: In order to load $40 onto their Food Lion MVP card, the patient must make a purchase of any amount using both their MVP loyalty card and their EBT card at a participating Food Lion location.
●Step 3: The patient can then use their MVP card to access the $40 to purchase fresh fruits and vegetables at any participating Food Lion location.
Other programs are further leveraging technology to streamline the produce prescription process. Wholesome Wave has partnered with Tangelo  to pilot an application 
in California that allows patients to access their produce prescription digitally using their phone prescription program in counties where the prevalence of low fruit and vegetable intake and food insecurity are disproportionately high. This approach allowed them to target the produce prescription program in counties of greatest need.
1373
Another produce prescription program called Fresh Rx Farm to Hospital, operating in South Florida, focuses on identifying patients who receive Medicaid or Medicare and patients who pay out of pocket.
1374 Through Fresh 
Rx Farm to Hospital, oncology, cardiology, stroke and pediatric patients are provided with a free 16-week produce box subscription if they are on Medicare, Medicaid, or pay out-of-pocket for medical expenses.
1375 During 
the initial weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic, FreshRx launched Farm to Family, an initiative that provided weekly produce and personal protective equipment to first responders and families in need.
1376
Issuing Produce Prescriptions
Once eligible patients are identified by a health care provider, they are provided with a “prescription” or referral that can be fulfilled through food retail and enables them to access free or discounted produce.
1377,1378 The 
mechanism for distributing funds to purchase produce in retail settings can include paper vouchers, scannable coupons, loyalty cards, funds loaded onto electronic cards, and phone applications.
1379
A report of produce prescription programs in the United States commissioned by Wholesome Wave found that the majority (67 percent) of programs issued funds for produce prescriptions in the form of vouchers or coupons.
1380 In a series of more than 60 
interviews conducted by The Center for Health Law and Policy Innovation at Harvard Law School, interviewees (including produce prescription program participants, retailers, and coordinators) reported that the advantages 128   PART III  Food as Medicine: Interventions, Programs, Policies and Practices   PART III  Food as Medicine: Interventions, Programs, Policies and Practices   129pharmaceutical prescription to treat high blood 
pressure and who are also enrolled in SNAP. The produce prescription can be redeemed for $30 worth of fresh fruits and vegetables at more than fifteen farmers’ market locations operated by GrowNYC. Cross-sector collaboration between healthcare institutions and farmers’ markets can benefit both patients and local farmers. Marcel Van Ooyen, President and CEO of GrowNYC, stated “This initiative has successfully introduced community members to their neighborhood farmers’ market, connecting them to this important resource for fresh food and simple, healthy recipes. We want to see small family farms thrive, and all residents, regardless of income, have affordable access to the foods they need to be healthy.”
1381
Collaboration between health care providers and community food retailers may also serve to increase patient awareness of local food resources available to support healthy diets. In addition to providing farmers’ market vouchers, The Food Rx program in Chicago 
also provided diabetic patients with coupons to Walgreens to increase awareness about the recent expansion of fresh produce available at this retailer.
1382 A 2019 qualitative study
published in the Journal of General Internal 
Medicine  found that a produce prescription 
program in Cleveland Ohio increased participant awareness of farmers’ markets that operate in the community as well as how to use local produce.
1383
A growing number of hospitals have also implemented produce prescription programs that integrate both the referral and redemption processes on-site at a location within the healthcare system, eliminating the need for participants to visit a community partner to redeem their prescriptions. This approach can potentially address challenges such as transportation and limited food retail hours that may limit participation in community-based redemption models.
1384,1385,1386number.1387 Through this program, funds 
for produce prescriptions are loaded to the Tangelo app as a restricted wallet that can only be used to purchase fruits and vegetables.
1388HealthEBucksRX  is another 
technology application that has been piloted at community health centers and allows healthcare providers to create digital vouchers that can be distributed by email, text, or hardcopy to patients and redeemed directly with food retailers by scanning the barcode.
1389
Electronic reporting with HealthEBucksRx allows providers to track patient compliance and sponsors to reimburse retailers.
Partners in Produce Prescription 
Programs
Partnerships are critical to the successful 
implementation of produce prescription programs.
1390,1391 A wide variety of partners 
have been used to redeem prescriptions for fruits and vegetables including farmers’ markets, grocery and retail stores, mobile markets, farm stands, food pantries, as well as on-site distribution where the prescription was administered.
1392 A national report 
commissioned by Wholesome Wave found that 48 percent of programs utilized farmers’ markets and 29 percent utilized grocery retail locations to redeem produce prescriptions, while 20 percent of programs reported on-site produce distribution where participants receive their prescribed amount of produce directly at their healthcare institution.
1393
The most common type of redemption partner used in produce prescription programs is farmers’ markets.
1394,1395Pharmacy to Farm is a 
produce prescription program administered by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene that partners with GrowNYC, a farmers’ market operator, and local pharmacies to provide patients with fresh fruits and vegetables.
1396 Through this program, 
pharmacists provide monthly produce prescriptions to patients filling a Boston Medical Center was the first hospital system to launch a therapeutic food pantry in 2001 to address the nutritional needs of low-income patients with a variety of chronic health conditions including cancer, HIV/AIDS, hypertension, diabetes, obesity and heart disease.
1397 Through this program, patients 
are identified by primary care providers who write and issue produce prescriptions that are then redeemed at the on-site Preventative 
Food Pantry for perishable food items such as fruits, vegetables and meats. The on-site food pantry is open five days a week and patients can redeem their prescriptions up to two times per month.
1398
In 2018, the Children’s Hospital of Pennsylvania launched the first pediatric, hospital-based Food Pharmacy  program to 
promote nutrition and address food insecurity among families in primary care and specialty care sites.
1399 Through this program patients 
are screened for food insecurity at clinical visits and referred to the on-site Food Pharmacy where they receive a three-day supply of nutritious food for the household. Food insecure families are able to access the Food Pharmacy at follow up clinical visits.
1400
Geisinger, a regional health care provider that serves parts of Pennsylvania and New Jersey,
1401 began an initiative called Fresh 
Food Farmacy in 2016.1402 The program 
serves patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes who have experienced food insecurity in the past year.
1403 Enrollees in the program receive 
a prescription of diabetes-appropriate food, and are then able to pick up the ingredients needed on-site to cook ten nutritious meals each week.
1404 In addition, patients receive 
more than 20 hours of diabetes education and access to free nutrition and wellness classes.
1405,1406 Early stages of data collection 
for the program have shown that providing food to diabetic patients is much less expensive than providing them with medical care.
1407 According to an editorial  published in the American Journal of Health Promotion in 2019, the program reported “seeing a 20 percent higher care gap compliance rate for those enrolled in the program. We have also seen a 2-full point reduction in HbA1c among program participants.”
1408
Outcomes and Opportunities
Produce prescription programs represent a promising healthcare intervention to improve food security among targeted patient populations.
1409 Research has 
demonstrated that produce prescription programs can improve fruit and vegetable consumption,
1410,1411,1412,1413,1414 nutrition 
knowledge,1415,1416,1417,1418 and food purchasing 
practices1419,1420  among a variety of patient 
populations. The benefits of produce prescription programs are multifaceted as they can reduce barriers to dietary changes by improving affordability and accessibility of fruits and vegetables and increasing knowledge related to diet-related health conditions.
1421,1422,1423,1424.
While produce prescription programs have been shown to improve the consumption of fruits and vegetables among targeted patient populations, evidence of the effectiveness of these programs on health outcomes are less clear.
1425,1426,1427 Findings from a 
systematic scoping review  published in the 
American Journal of Health Promotion  in 2021 
reviewed 23 studies published on produce prescription programs and concluded that “studies incorporating health metrics reported mixed effectiveness, with little consensus on the impacts of food prescriptions on blood pressure, BMI, or glucose homeostasis.”
1428
Authors attribute inconsistent findings to poor study designs and limited time frames in a nascent body of funded programs.
1429
Produce prescription programs represent a burgeoning field in the Food as Medicine landscape and will require more rigorous research in order to demonstrate their impact 130   PART III  Food as Medicine: Interventions, Programs, Policies and Practices   PART III  Food as Medicine: Interventions, Programs, Policies and Practices   131is as meaningful and culturally appropriate as 
it is nutritious.”1430
Culinary Medicine 
Food science, nutrition, and cooking come together in the science of culinary medicine, which aims to improve patients’ conditions by analyzing how food can play a role in preventing or treating a particular disease. According to John La Puma, MD, the Clinical Director and Founder of Chef Clinic, “culinary medicine is a new evidence-based field in medicine that blends the art of food and cooking with the science of medicine.”
1431
Culinary medicine takes into account an individual’s conditions and dietary needs when designing home-cooked meals and meal plans.
1432 As physician Irl B. Hirsch (et al.) 
wrote in Clinical Therapeutics  in 2019:
Specifically, culinary medicine adds 
to existing nutrition interventions by integrating the concept of “food pleasure” (ie, both the sensory-based experience of food in terms of taste, smell, texture, and appearance, and the emotions surrounding food) with the scientific knowledge of how food and dietary choices may influence human metabolism, immunity, and pathophysiology.
1433
It is important to note that culinary medicine 
is not focused on prescribing specific foods to patients, nor does it attempt to replace prescription medications.
1434 In fact, culinary 
medicine can be used in conjunction with prescription medications and other nutritional and dietary interventions.
1435,1436 Dr. La Puma 
wrote of culinary medicine in the journal Population Health Management :
Culinary medicine is not nutrition, dietetics, 
or preventive, integrative, or internal medicine, nor is it the culinary arts or food science... Culinary medicine is aimed at helping people reach good personal medical decisions about on longitudinal health outcomes and support 
their integration into national policy.1437 In 
2022, The Aspen Institute recently released the Food is Medicine Research Action Planwhich provides the following recommendations for future research designs of Food as Medicine interventions:
1438
●Research should be appropriately powered to meaningfully evaluate primary outcomes
●Researchers should prioritize rigorous research designs with a combination of quantitative and qualitative approaches
●Research should always report process and engagement metrics
●Researchers should carefully consider whether the intensity and duration of the intervention is likely to influence outcomes of interest
●Metrics for specific health conditions should be developed in collaboration with primary care and specialist conditions
Produce prescription programs may also have the potential to promote health equity in communities underserved by supermarkets and healthy food retailers. Produce Rx , 
a produce prescription program run by the Washington DC-based nonprofit DC Greens, helps residents of Ward 8, one of D.C.’s predominantly Black neighborhoods, afford fresh fruits and vegetables from the neighborhood’s only full-service grocery store.
1439 In April 2021, Wholesome Wave’s 
CEO, Benjamin Perkins, MA, MDiv, participated in a panel about promoting health equity through food as medicine hosted by the University of Pennsylvania’s Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics.
1440 Regarding 
the operation of a successful food prescription program, Perkins said: “It’s about listening to that community and using their input to inform the way programs are designed and operated. And it’s not just about giving them any kind of food, but rather providing them with food that 
132   PART III  Food as Medicine: Interventions, Programs, Policies and Practices   PART III  Food as Medicine: Interventions, Programs, Policies and Practices   133accessing and eating high-quality meals 
that help prevent and treat disease and restore well-being.
1441
Culinary Medicine in Medical School
Culinary medicine, as an emerging field 
that incorporates the principles of food as medicine, has started to gain traction among physicians and medical schools.
1442,1443 In 
the United States, United Kingdom, and Spain, “culinary medicine” movements are blending clinical medicine with individual nutrition education that is focused on the practical aspects of food preparation and cooking.
1444 These programs support a health 
care professional’s willingness and ability to recognize nutrition needs and provide appropriate and practical advice to patients.
1445
The first medical school to offer a cooking and nutrition elective in the United States was the State University of New York - Upstate Medical University, in Syracuse, in 2003.
1446
One of the most prolific culinary medicine projects is the Health Meets Food culinary medicine curriculum , which was developed 
by Timothy S. Harlan, MD, FACP, a world renowned doctor, chef, teacher and author, while at Tulane University. Dr. Harlan who spent his pre-medical career working in, and eventually owning a restaurant, is also known as Dr. Gourmet.
1447 Currently, the Health 
Meets Food culinary curriculum consists of more than 30 content-specific modules designed for health care professionals. “Each of the educational modules presents basic and clinical science related to evidence-based nutritional and dietary goals for specific topics, case presentations, recipes, cooking instructions, discussion questions, and quizzes.”
1448 The Health Meets Food 
culinary curriculum is used by medical students, residents, and clinicians at more than 55 academic medical centers across the world. Currently, Dr. Harlan is at the George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences assisting with its culinary medicine programming.
Dr. Harlan is also a senior advisor and former 
executive director of The Goldring Center for Culinary Medicine at Tulane University’s School of Medicine in New Orleans, Louisiana.
1449 Founded in 2012, The Goldring 
Center is the nation’s first culinary medicine center at a medical school. The teaching kitchen provides hands-on training for medical students and residents through elective culinary medicine classes and mandatory interdisciplinary seminars. The Goldring Center also provides Community Classes to the local community interested in learning about nutrition.
1450
Some culinary medicine programs have a dual focus: to teach participating medical students how to better manage their own health as well as that of their patients.
1451
The courses emphasize cooking with fresh fruits and vegetables and teach participants how to select, store, prepare, and even grow their own produce in order to maximize its nutritional value.
1452 Dr. Jaclyn Albin, the 
Associate Program Director for the University of Texas Southwestern’s Internal Medicine and Pediatrics Residency program, has pioneered culinary medicine courses for her students.
1453
She hopes that culinary medicine will foster lifestyle changes that place students in a better position to manage their health, deal with stress, and reap the benefits of any other medical care they are undergoing, including therapy and dietary consultation.
1454
The inclusion of culinary medicine within medical training has shown evidence-based efficacy in improving the nutrition knowledge and confidence of medical students as they graduate and become board-certified physicians.
1455,1456 One study published in 
Advances in Preventive Medicine  compared 
medical students who participated in a cooking and nutrition elective in a medical school-
134   PART III  Food as Medicine: Interventions, Programs, Policies and Practices   PART III  Food as Medicine: Interventions, Programs, Policies and Practices   135Culinary Nutrition
Culinary nutrition is a term used to describe 
the practice of incorporating nutrition and food science knowledge into individual preparation of food,
1457 resulting in “an 
interdisciplinary approach to food, ranging from nutrition and dietetics to culinary arts and gastronomic sciences,” wrote researchers in 
the International Journal of Gastronomy and Food Science  in 2021.
1458 This interdisciplinary 
approach is proving effective; culinary nutrition education programs are gaining traction as motivators for behavior change in patients managing chronic disease.
1459 According to 
a 2020 article in Health Promotion Practice , 
“Evidence of the benefits of culinary nutrition education is growing in the literature. Culinary nutrition education programs are naturally experiential, social, skills-based, and effective in improving nutrition-related beliefs, knowledge, and behaviors.”
1460 While 
the term “culinary nutrition” is often used interchangeably with culinary medicine, the latter is primarily associated with educating physicians and health care workers as well as physician extenders.
1461,1462 Jacqueline B. 
Marcus, MS, RDN, author of Culinary Nutrition: The Science and Practice of Healthy Cooking , 
writes, “People have integrated nutrition, food science and cooking since the beginning of time—without even knowing it.” 
Dietary Supplements, 
Nutraceuticals and Functional Foods
Dietary supplements, nutraceuticals 
(sometimes called “bioceuticals”), and functional foods are foods, or supplements to food, that are ingested with the intention of providing a physiological or medicinal effect.
1463,1464,1465based teaching kitchen versus traditional clinical education. The cooking and nutrition elective resulted in a 72 percent increase in the reporting of total proficiency in providing nutrition counseling to patients.
1466 According 
to a survey of medical students published in the American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine , 
during the 2019-2020 academic year, a 3-hour culinary medicine training was found to have positive effects on the students’ “nutrition knowledge, skills, and attitudes and confidence in patient nutrition counseling.”
1467
Various schools and organizations provide continuing medical education (CME) to physicians and other health care providers about nutrition and food as medicine:
1468
The American College of Preventive Medicine now offers an Introduction to Culinary Medicinecourse focusing on “provider education that seeks to incorporate self-care while counseling and empowering patients to make and sustain healthier food choices through shopping and meal preparation,” and provides continuing medical education credits and maintenance of certification credits.
1469,1470
The American College of Lifestyle Medicine offers an online CME program called Lifestyle 
Medicine Core Competencies , which includes 
nutrition education alongside other lifestyle practices such as sleep health, weight management, and alcohol use.
1471 The CME’s 
are offered through a collaboration with Rush University Medical Center, American College of Preventive Medicine and the American College of Lifestyle Medicine.The Health meets Food Culinary Medicine Program offers a Certified Culinary Medicine Specialist  program for clinicians to learn 
how to “[e]xplore the implications of diet on overall health; Enhance the quality of patient counseling; [and] Improve the management of diet-related chronic diseases.”
1472 This 
is a hybrid program, with some virtual (both live and asynchronous) and some in-person components.
1473Dietary Supplements
The National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements (NIH ODS) defines a dietary supplement as “[a] product (other than tobacco) that is intended to supplement the diet; contains one or more dietary ingredients (including vitamins, minerals, herbs or other botanicals, amino acids, and other substances) or their components; is intended to be taken by mouth as a pill, capsule, tablet, or liquid; and is identified on the front label of the product as being a dietary supplement.”
1474 Products of this 
type are not called “dietary supplements” in every jurisdiction; for example, the United Kingdom’s Food Standards Agency calls them “food supplements,” defined as “any food the purpose of which is to supplement the normal diet and which is a concentrated source of a vitamin or mineral or other substance with a nutritional or physiological effect, alone or in combination and is sold in dose form.”
1475 The European Commission 
defines food supplements as “concentrated sources of nutrients (or other substances) with a nutritional or physiological effect. Such food supplements can be marketed in “dose” form, such as pills, tablets, capsules, liquids in measured doses, etc.”
1476
According to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), which is conducted annually, about half of American adults use dietary supplements.
1477,1478,1479,1480,1481 And that number 
is on the rise, particularly among athletes and those with chronic illnesses.
1482,1483,1484 Rates 
of supplement use also tend to vary based on factors such as income, food security, and participation in food assistance programs (such as SNAP).
1485,1486 Based on 2011-2014 
data from NHANES:
[Dietary supplement (DS)] and 
[multivitamin-mineral (MVM)] use was significantly higher among those with a household income of ≥ 350% of the poverty level, those who were food secure, and SNAP income-ineligible nonparticipants across all sex, age, and race/ethnic groups. Among women, prevalence of use significantly differed between SNAP participants (39%) and SNAP income-eligible nonparticipants (54%). Older adults (71+ years) remained the highest consumers of DS, specifically among the highest income group (82%), while younger adults (19–30 years), predominantly in the lowest income group (28%), were the lowest consumers.
1487
Among children, the difference in supplement 
use by socioeconomic characteristics was similar:
DS and MVM use were associated with 
higher family income and higher household food security level. DS use was lowest among children in households participating in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP; 20%) and those participating in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC; 26%) compared to both income-eligible and income-ineligible nonparticipants. Most children who used DS took only one (83%) or two (12%) products; although children in low-income families took fewer products than those in higher income families. The most common motivations for DS and MVM use were to “improve (42% or 46%)” or “maintain (34 or 38%)” health, followed by “to supplement the diet (23 or 24%)” for DS or MVM, respectively. High-income children were more likely to use DS and MVM “to supplement the diet” than middle- or low-income children. Only 18% of child DS users took DS based on a health practitioner’s recommendation. In conclusion, DS use was lower among children who were in low-income or food-insecure families, or families participating in nutrition assistance programs.

Office of Dietary Supplements (NIH ODS) recommendations for taking dietary supplements
The NIH ODS recommends that people who are interested in taking dietary supplements 
to treat their health conditions keep the following in mind:
●If you are scheduled to have any type of surgical procedure, talk with your health 
care provider about any supplements you take. 
●Keep in mind the term ‘natural’ doesn’t always mean safe. Some all-natural botanical products, for example, like comfrey and kava, can harm the liver. A dietary supplement’s safety depends on many things, such as its chemical makeup, how it works in the body, how it is prepared, and the amount you take. 
●Before taking any dietary supplement, talk to your health care providers to answer these questions:
οWhat are its potential benefits for me?
οDoes it have any safety risks?
οWhat is the proper dose to take?
οHow, when, and for how long should I take it?1489
The NIH ODS acknowledges the potential health benefits of certain supplements:
●Calcium and vitamin D help keep bones strong and reduce bone loss. 
●Folic acid decreases the risk of certain birth defects.
●Omega-3 fatty acids from fish oils might help some people with heart disease. 
●A combination of vitamins C and E, zinc, copper, lutein, and zeaxanthin may slow down further vision loss in people with age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
1490
Furthermore, the NIH ODS notes that consumers should be aware of potential negative interactions between dietary supplements and pharmaceutical medicines:
●Vitamin K can reduce the ability of the blood thinner warfarin to prevent blood from clotting.
●St. John’s wort can speed the breakdown of many medicines and reduce their effectiveness (including some antidepressants, birth control pills, heart medications, anti-HIV medications, and transplant drugs).
●Antioxidant supplements, such as vitamins C and E, might reduce the effectiveness of some types of cancer chemotherapy.
1491by many supplementation programme 
managers as being the main barriers to success.

Despite the prevalence of dietary supplements 
(which are often food extracts), studies have found that most users are not knowledgeable about the active ingredients, possible side effects, or recommended dosages of what they were taking.
1493,1494,1495,1496 Patients’ lack 
of knowledge seems partially attributable to their lack of communication with medical professionals regarding the potential benefits and risks of supplement use.
1497,1498,1499 Of 
those who responded to the NHANES surveys
between 2007 and 2010, 77 percent had self-prescribed dietary supplements without consulting a healthcare provider.
1500,1501 Many 
of these individuals further reported that they avoided discussing the use of supplements with their physicians because they felt that their doctors lacked knowledge or were biased against the practice.
1502,1503
Many patients, physicians, and researchers have questioned the safety of taking dietary supplements.
1504,1505,1506 As mentioned above, 
the NIH ODS warns patients about the potential negative effects of supplements’ interaction with other medicines.
1507 Some 
researchers argue that there is little benefit at all to taking supplements, and are therefore not worth the potential risk of taking something unknown and potentially harmful.
1508,1509
However, in an 11-year study from 1999 to 2010, published in Annals of Internal 
Medicine  in 2019, of 30,899 adults taking 
supplements, researchers found that use of dietary supplements  was not connected to increased mortality.
1510
Supplement Use Among Athletes
The trend of self-prescription also holds among elite athletes, among whom dietary supplement use is significantly more prevalent A study appearing in JAMA Internal Medicine
analyzing three years (2007-2010) of NHANES data submitted by nearly  12,000 patients reported that some individuals were able to articulate specific reasons for taking supplements, including the use of calcium products to promote “bone health.”
1511 Most 
individuals surveyed, however, could only explain their use of dietary supplements in general terms, reporting that they used supplements to “improve” or “maintain” overall health.
1512 Individuals of all ages use 
supplements. NHANES data from 2006-2014 showed that during that time period, 33.2 percent of children and adolescents in the United States used dietary supplements (particularly multivitamins, supplements for immunity, omega-3 fatty acids, and sleep aids).
1513 However, according to data from the 
2017-2018 NHANES, rates of supplement use tend to increase with age.
1514
Supplement use has also been proposed as a method to combat nutritional insecurity.
1515
The Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations and the World Health Organization released a report back in 2006 
outlining methods for improving nutritional security globally, and included information about dietary supplements.
1516 The report 
notes that supplementation programs have been used to improve iron and folic acid levels among children, pregnant women, and postpartum women in developing countries.
1517
However, there are some obstacles facing these dietary supplementation programs as noted in this joint report:
Supplementation usually requires 
the procurement and purchase of micronutrients in a relatively expensive pre-packaged form, an effective distribution system and a high degree of consumer compliance (especially if supplements need to be consumed on a long-term basis). A lack of supplies and poor compliance are consistently reported 138   PART III  Food as Medicine: Interventions, Programs, Policies and Practices   PART III  Food as Medicine: Interventions, Programs, Policies and Practices   139
than it is among average Americans.1518
This heightened frequency of use, 
however, does not seem to correspond to increased scientific knowledge of how these supplements may impact the body.
1519,1520
In multiple studies conducted from 2003 to 2021, athletes have reported taking supplements to achieve a broad range of health goals, including improved performance, enhanced muscle recovery, and disease prevention
1521,1522,1523,1524,1525,1526,1527
In a 2019 survey of elite athletes in Spain published in the Journal of the International 
Society of Sports Nutrition, more than 60 percent of respondents stated that they used dietary supplements, including supplements that had little evidence backing their efficacy.
1528 Nearly half of the 
respondents said that they relied primarily on themselves as sources of information, rather than a physician, nutritionist, or other health care professional.
1529 “This 
information points towards the necessity of increasing the knowledge of the benefits and risks of supplementation in the elite athlete population,” the authors wrote.
1530 In addition, 
a 2010 study published in JAMA Internal 
Medicine  showed that the majority of athletes 
surveyed did not know the active ingredients or mechanisms of action of the supplements they were taking, and only half of the athletes knew the recommended supplement dosages.
1531 Less than half of these athletes 
said they consulted their medical providers before starting supplementation.
1532
Nutraceuticals
The term “nutraceutical” was coined by founder and chairman of the Foundation for Innovation in Medicine, Stephen DeFelice, in 1989 to describe a food or part of a food with therapeutic benefits, particularly in the prevention or treatment of disease.
1533,1534,1535,1536 A 2014 review  of 
studies on nutraceuticals, published in theInternational Journal of Preventive Medicine ,
defines nutraceuticals as “products, which other than nutrition are also used as medicine.”
1537 According to two research 
scientists in a 2020 editorial  in the journal 
Nutrients, “Nutraceuticals and nutrition supplements are collectively referred to as ‘dietary supplements,’ intended to be taken orally.”
1538
However, there is no official definition of nutraceutical yet accepted by government agencies, health care professionals, and nutrition researchers.
1539,1540 “Currently, 
nutraceuticals do not have a specific definition distinct from those of other food‐derived categories, such as food supplements, herbal products, pre‐ and probiotics, functional foods, and fortified foods,” write researchers in a 2018 review in the British Journal of Clinical 
Pharmacology .
1541 This lack of consensus 
might lead to confusion about the purpose and efficacy of different products for consumers.
1542
According to the researchers: 
Many studies have led to an understanding 
of the potential mechanisms of action of pharmaceutically active components contained in food that may improve health and reduce the risk of pathological conditions while enhancing overall well‐being. Nevertheless, there is a lack of clear information and, often, the claimed health benefits may not be properly substantiated by safety and efficacy information or in vitro and in vivo data, which can induce false expectations and miss the target for a product to be effective, as claimed.
1543
According to two research scientists in 
a 2020 editorial  in the journal Nutrients, 
“Nutraceuticals and nutrition supplements are collectively referred to as ‘dietary supplements,’ intended to be taken orally.”
1544Well-known nutraceuticals include 
echinacea, green tea, ginseng, glucosamine, omega-3, folic acid, and cod liver oil.
1545140   PART III  Food as Medicine: Interventions, Programs, Policies and Practices   PART III  Food as Medicine: Interventions, Programs, Policies and Practices   141
based on the assumption that supplement 
products may offer health benefits or ‘immune-boosting’ effects if consumed.”
1546,1547,1548,1549,1550
The increased attention paid to these products raised questions about their safety and efficacy in the treatment and prevention of COVID-19.
1551 As noted above in dietary supplements, 
the NIH ODS cautions patients to be aware of potential harmful side effects from the use of supplements, including nutraceuticals.
1552
As researchers wrote in a 2021 review  in the 
journal mSystems:
Consumers need to be aware of 
misinformation and false promises surrounding some supplements, which may be subject to limited regulation by authorities. However, considerably more research is required to determine whether dietary supplements and nutraceuticals exhibit prophylactic and therapeutic value against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19.
1553
For example, elderberry (which is often 
hypothesized to have antiviral properties1554) 
has been a nutraceutical of interest in the treatment and prevention of COVID-19.
1555
However, there is little conclusive evidence about its efficacy;
1556 furthermore, elderberry 
has potentially dangerous side effects (including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and others) and cannot be consumed raw or undercooked, so patients should be very cautious with this nutraceutical.
1557The majority of nutraceuticals have multiple therapeutic properties and “may be used to improve health, delay the aging process, prevent chronic diseases, increase life expectancy, or support the structure or function of the body.”
1558 However, not all 
nutraceuticals provide the health effects they purport to: in a 2018 systematic review of randomized controlled trials  published 
in the British Journal of Nutrition  studying 
the impact of nutraceutical use on cognition among older adults, the researchers “failed to locate sufficient evidence to justify long-term use to improve cognitive function.”
1559 The 
researchers also note that further studies are needed to understand the efficacy of certain nutraceuticals such as folic acid, curcumin, and Yamabushitake mushroom. Furthermore, they write that “the combination of dietary and nutraceutical interventions may be a promising strategy to improve cognitive function.”
1560
Despite the lack of evidence about the impact of certain nutraceuticals on health, the market for these products is growing.
1561
While investigating the commercialization of food and medicine, Lisa Haushofer, MD, PhD, a senior research associate at the Institute for Biomedical Ethics and History of Medicine at the University of Zurich, noted that “the nutraceutical and health foods markets are among the fastest growing and most promising markets worldwide.”
1562 According 
to Precedence Research, a worldwide market research and consulting organization, in 2020 the global nutraceuticals market size was valued  at $160.3 billion and is expected to rise 
to $314.2 billion by 2030.
1563
Nutraceuticals have steadily grown over the past decade and saw a significant rise in early 2020 from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which caused the COVID-19 pandemic.
1564
During this time “consumers sought additional protections from viral infection and disease 142   PART III  Food as Medicine: Interventions, Programs, Policies and Practices   PART III  Food as Medicine: Interventions, Programs, Policies and Practices   143Spotlight: Food for Specified Health Uses 
in Japan
Japan was one of the first governments to regulate functional foods and explore the 
health benefits of foods through robust research and testing.1565,1566,1567 The Japanese 
Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare oversees the approval process for these foods, which are called Food for Specified Health Uses (FOSHU).
1568,1569 To be approved for a 
FOSHU label, a food must meet the following requirements:
●“Effectiveness on the human body is clearly proven 
●Absence of any safety issues (animal toxicity tests, confirmation of effects in the 
cases of excess intake, etc.) 
●Use of nutritionally appropriate ingredients (e.g. no excessive use of salt, etc.) 
●Guarantee of compatibility with product specifications by the time of consumption 
●Established quality control methods, such as specifications of products and ingredients, processes, and methods of analysis”
1570
Furthermore, there are three other types of FOSHU: Qualified (scientific evidence 
is minimal and has not met the standard for an approved FOSHU), Standardized (functional attributes of ingredients in a product have already been approved as individual FOSHU, and the foods therefore do not always require clinical trials), and reduction of disease risk (there is sufficient clinical evidence that a certain food or ingredient is connected to lowered risk of a certain disease).
1571
Since 2012, more than 1,000 products have consistently held an approved FOSHU label. 
1572,1573  FOSHUs can be approved for certain specified uses: changing 
gastrointestinal health, lowering blood cholesterol, regulating blood sugar levels, impacting blood pressure, assisting in dental hygiene, aiding in mineral absorption, and encouraging bone growth. 
1574, 1575, 1576
Japan has one of the lowest rates of obesity and highest average lifespans in the world, 
1577, 1578 and some researchers have argued that diet play a role in these statistics. 1579,
1580,1581  “We need to increase the evidence base of the impact of the whole Japanese 
dietary lifestyle on health as well as having specific studies on the functionality and health benefits of individual food items,” said Eriko Komiya, Director of Food Cultures Office in the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture Forestry and Fisheries, in an article for 
Nature. 
1582●Processed foods containing ingredients 
that aid specific bodily functions in addition to being nutritious.
1583
Christiani Jeyakumar Henry, PhD, MSc, the director of the Clinical Nutrition Research Centre at the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) in Singapore and the Deputy Executive Director at the Singapore Institute of Food Biotechnology and Innovation (SIFBI), wrote about the start of the functional 
food movement in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition :  
The conviction to develop functional foods 
first emerged in Japan in the 1980s when faced with escalating health-care costs. The Ministry of Health and Welfare initiated a regulatory system to approve certain foods with documented health benefits. Its primary objective was to improve the health of the nation’s ageing population. In 1984, the Ministry of Education, Science and Culture, an ad hoc group 
in Japan commenced a national project to explore the link between food and medical sciences. The term ‘functional food’ first appeared in 1993 in the Nature
news magazine under the heading ‘Japan explores the boundary between food and medicine’.
1584
Dr. Henry, a world renowned expert on 
functional foods, also described functional foods as the following: 
●Conventional food containing naturally occurring bioactive substance. An example could be β-glucan in oat bran to lower blood cholesterol; [Note: β-glucan is a water-soluble dietary fiber found in the cell walls of plants]
1585
●Foods that have been modified, by enrichment or other means, with bioactive substances. An example could be margarine that contains added phytosterol that is known to lower serum cholesterol; In addition to increased use of nutraceuticals from the COVID-19 pandemic, several other factors have contributed to the popularity of nutraceuticals as an area of research and treatment. Research has demonstrated that nutraceuticals may have a lower risk of addiction and serious side effects than many current pharmaceutical treatments for pain and serious disease.
1586,1587,1588 (Note that more 
clinical research is needed to understand the potential use of nutraceuticals in managing pain.)
1589,1590 Given that nutraceuticals are 
derived from food, they may also be less expensive to produce than most conventional pharmaceuticals.
1591 Finally, the rising 
interest in nutraceuticals may follow the rising consumer demand in the intersection of food and health.
1592
Functional Foods 
Functional foods, defined  by researcher 
Marcello Nicoletti, a professor of Environmental Biology at Sapienza University of Rome, are “foods or food ingredients that have additional health or physiological benefits over and above the normal nutritional value they provide.”
1593 Typically, the distinction 
between nutraceuticals and functional foods lies in how they are ingested: “nutraceuticals” are supplements that are not consumed as conventional food or drink, whereas “functional foods” are consumed as conventional food or drink.
1594
While there is no universal and unanimous definition of a functional food, several options
in various languages have been proposed to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, including:
●A foodstuff that provides a health benefit beyond basic nutrition, demonstrating specific health or medical benefits, including the prevention and treatment of disease.144   PART III  Food as Medicine: Interventions, Programs, Policies and Practices   PART III  Food as Medicine: Interventions, Programs, Policies and Practices   145●Synthesized food ingredients, such as 
some specialized carbohydrates intended to have probiotic effects.
●A functional food can be (1) a natural food, (2) a food to which a component has been added, (3) a food from which a component has been removed, (4) a food where one or more components has been modified, (5) a food in which the bioavailability has been modified or (6) any combination of these.
1595
Functional foods are often used by consumers seeking optimal health and prevention or treatment of disease, and do not need to be used under the supervision of a health care professional.
1596,1597,1598,1599 For example, 
probiotics, commonly found in fermented dairy products, are often considered to be functional foods for their benefits to the gastrointestinal tract by balancing the gut microbiome to potentially relieve gastrointestinal discomfort.
1600,1601 Many health care 
professionals and scientists consider all fruits and vegetables to be functional foods due to their rich amounts of important compounds such as fiber and antioxidants.
1602,1603
Functional foods can also be foods that are fortified or otherwise enhanced with vitamins, nutrients, phytochemicals, or other components that have health benefits.
1604
These are often called “fortified foods,” and include milk with added vitamin D, iodized salt, or cereals with added folic acid.
1605,1606
The FDA has no official definition for “functional food,”
1607 so the phrase often 
ends up as a marketing term for various food products.
1608 Interest in and demand 
for functional foods is growing in the United States and globally,
1609 so consumers should 
be encouraged to inform themselves about the functions and benefits that different foods claim to have. Additional Examples of Dietary 
Supplements, Nutraceuticals, and Functional Foods
Certain foods have been proven to support 
general health in addition to being effective in the treatment, co-treatment, and prevention of specific disease states.
1610,1611,1612 Research 
has demonstrated that functional dietary changes can impact an individual’s heart, brain, and bone health:
●Heart Health: Nuts and seeds have been shown to help lower cholesterol.
1613,1614,1615
Fish oil and olive oil can help reduce inflammation, which is associated with heart disease.
1616,1617 More specifically, fish 
contains omega-3 fatty acids, which can lower blood fats (triglycerides).
1618,16191620
Whole grains consumption has also been associated with reduced levels of homocysteine,
1621 an amino acid 
associated with heart disease.1622
●Brain Health: Peanuts, eggs, fish, meat, and other foods that are high in choline elevate acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter responsible for healthy mental function.
1623,1624,1625 Vitamin E is a fat-
soluble antioxidant that helps protect the fatty environment of the brain.
1626,1627,1628
And whole grains rich in vitamin B, such as brown rice or barley, help reduce levels of homocysteine, which is associated with dementia.
1629,1630,1631 Migraines can be 
attributed to a diet lacking in folate (found in leafy greens).
1632
●Bone Health: Calcium fortifies bones, and vitamin D plays an essential role in calcium absorption.
1633 Milk, salmon, 
and dark green vegetables all contain calcium. Almost all milk sold in the United States is fortified with vitamin D,
1634 and 
sunlight helps your body create vitamin D.
1635 Magnesium (found in almonds, 
lentils, seeds, and spinach) works in conjunction with calcium to promote bone health.
1636,1637,1638Many dietary supplements, nutraceuticals, and functional foods are used by consumers across the world to help manage their health. The National Institutes of Health has numerous resources that provide current, evidence-based information for consumers and health care providers about many different foods and supplements. Below is information from the National Institutes of Health, including the Office of Dietary Supplements (NIH ODS), the National Center of Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH), and the National Library of Medicine, about some popular supplements and functional foods: 
●Capsicum: Also known as red pepper or chili pepper, the capsicum plant contains a chemical called capsaicin, which is commonly used to reduce pain from a variety of chronic conditions, including diabetic neuropathy, arthritis, and others.
1639 The National Library of Medicine 
notes that while capsaicin has also been used for issues such as indigestion problems, “but there is no good scientific evidence for many of these uses.”
1640
●Cranberry: According to the NCCIH, “Historically, cranberry fruits or leaves were used for bladder, stomach, and liver disorders, as well as diabetes, wounds, and other conditions.”
1641 Today, cranberry 
is most often associated with treatment of UTIs, and generally studies show that cranberry products reduce the risk of UTIs; however, there have been inconsistent results among various populations.
1642
●Garlic: Garlic, a popular cooking ingredient, is also commonly available as a dietary supplement. It is most commonly associated with treating heart and blood conditions, such as high blood cholesterol and high blood pressure.
1643 However, 
the NCCIH notes that there is conflicting evidence about the impact of garlic on cholesterol and blood pressure.
1644 To read 
more about garlic as medicine, see the Spotlight on page 32.  ●Green Tea: The NCCIH writes, “Green tea as a beverage or dietary supplement is promoted for improving mental alertness, relieving digestive symptoms and headaches, and promoting weight loss.”
1645
However, there is insufficient evidence to definitely conclude that green tea is effective for these purposes.
●Niacin: Niacin, also called vitamin B3, is a nutrient with many uses, including assisting the body to turn food into energy, maintenance of genome integrity, control of gene expression, and cellular communication.
1646 It is found in a variety of 
foods (including animal foods and certain types of nuts, legumes, and grains), but it can also be added to some food products or purchased as a supplement.
1647
Insufficient niacin can lead to a skin condition called pellagra, characterized by a roughened, sunburned-like appearance and pigmented rash.
1648 However, the NIH 
ODS warns that taking too much niacin can lead to negative side effects such as headaches, rashes, and dizziness.
1649
●Omega-3 Fatty Acids: Found in foods such as fish and flaxseed, as well as supplements such as fish oil, omega-3 fatty acids are a collection of three fatty acids that partially make up cell membranes.
1650 One of these three acids 
cannot be produced by the body, so it must come from food; the other two can be produced by the body in very small amounts, so getting them from foods is much more practical.
1651
●Potassium: Potassium is found in a variety of foods: bananas, potatoes, spinach, kidney beans, and much more.
1652
According to the NIH ODS, “Your body needs potassium for almost everything it does, including proper kidney and heart function, muscle contraction, and nerve transmission.”
1653 However, abnormally 
high levels of potassium, a condition 146   PART III  Food as Medicine: Interventions, Programs, Policies and Practices   PART III  Food as Medicine: Interventions, Programs, Policies and Practices   147
●Lowering Cholesterol: Some studies have 
reported that phytosterols, a component of plant cell membranes commonly used as additives in food products, reduce “bad” low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by decreasing the amount the body produces and absorbs into the gastrointestinal tract.
1654,1655,1656,1657,1658
Other nutraceuticals in a few studies have demonstrated potential in reducing cholesterol and include the polyphenols in durian (an edible fruit),
1659,1660 certain 
kinds of green tea,1661,1662 Annurca apple 
polyphenolic extract,1663,1664,1665,1666 and 
a formulation that includes berberine (“a chemical found in some plants like European barberry, goldenseal, goldthread, Oregon grape, phellodendron, and tree turmeric,” according to the National Library of Medicine
1667) and red 
yeast rice.1668,1669,1670,1671
●Cancer: Cancer researchers are interested in the potential for nutraceuticals to provide lower-cost, reduced-risk ways of managing and treating the disease. For example, butein is a polyphenol, are “common antioxidants present in a large number of foods and beverages of plant origin,” 
1672 with a history of use in many 
East Asian traditional medical practices for its anticancer effects.
1673,1674 In a few 
studies, butein has been shown to have the ability to induce death in cancer cells.
1675,1676,1677,1678,1679,1680 In addition, 
phytosterols (plant-derived sterols similar in structure to cholesterol
1681,1682) 
in three types of algae have shown anticancer effects in a small group of studies.
1683,1684,1685,1686 There is also interest 
in finding applications for the management and treatment of cancer in lactic acid bacteria (LAB),
1687,1688,1689,1690,1691 which 
is prevalent in cultured and fermented foods.
1692●called hyperkalemia (most common in people with chronic kidney disease), can cause muscle weakness, numbness, tingling, nausea, and other symptoms in some patients.
1693
●Probiotics: Probiotics are defined by the NIH ODS as “live microorganisms (such as bacteria and yeasts) that provide health benefits when you consume them.”
1694 Probiotic food products include 
dairy products such as yogurt as well as certain non-dairy fermented foods.
1695
As noted above in Functional Foods, probiotics are often considered to be functional foods for their benefits to the gastrointestinal tract.
1696,1697
●Vitamin D: Vitamin D is used by the human body for many functions, including calcium absorption, muscle movement, and maintaining the immune system.
1698
According to the NIH ODS, “Very few foods naturally contain vitamin D. ” They note, however, that fatty fish, such as trout, salmon, tuna, and mackerel, is a good natural source of vitamin D.
1699 Many 
foods are thus fortified with vitamin D, such as cow’s milk, plant-based milk, and breakfast cereals.
1700
Note: See Office of Dietary Supplements’ Dietary Supplement Fact Sheets , the National 
Center of Complementary and Integrative Health’s Health Topics, and the National Library of Medicine’s Medline Plus  to learn 
more about specific foods and supplements.
Although extensive research into the 
various kinds of nutraceuticals and dietary supplements, their medical applications, and the potential risks associated with their use remains to be done, early studies have shown certain supplements may have potential for managing and treating disease. These include:148   PART III  Food as Medicine: Interventions, Programs, Policies and Practices   PART III  Food as Medicine: Interventions, Programs, Policies and Practices   149●Neurological Disorders: Neurological 
disorders have a variety of causes and risk factors, including stressful life events, psychological comorbidities, advanced age, and smoking .
1701,1702,1703
Over time, the brain undergoes oxidative stress, which plays a key role in numerous neurological disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD).
1704,1705
Antioxidants can be found in many food products, including curcumin, which is an antioxidant found in turmeric
1706,1707,1708
and the flavonoids in wine and tea, may, according to some studies, help to slow the progress of AD and similar conditions.
1709,1710,1711,1712 In addition, many 
neurological disorders, such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS), are caused by improper folding of proteins in the brain, a process that vitamin A,
1713,1714 β-carotene,1715,1716
and coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10)1717,1718,1719
all may help to combat.1720 The decline 
in function associated with Parkinson’s disease (PD) results from a drastic drop in the brain’s dopamine levels, and lycopene, an antioxidant found in tomatoes, papayas, and other red fruits and vegetables, has been shown to increase dopamine in mice, suggesting it may have potential for managing the disease in humans.
1721,1722,1723
●Inflammation: Certain nutraceuticals have proven effective as anti-inflammatories, showing potential on diseases such as cancer, neurological disorders, and arthritis.
1724,1725,1726 For example, 
ergosterol from edible mushrooms has been shown to reduce inflammatory responses,
1727,1728,1729 as have lactic 
acid bacteria1730 and some chemical 
compounds such as tocopherols and tocotrienols in the vitamin E family, found in seeds, nuts, and many vegetables.
1731
Polyphenols, found in olive oil, cocoa, and berries, have been found to have anti-inflammatory properties in the treatment of a wide range of diseases;1732,1733 and 
curcumin, a polyphenol found in turmeric, has also been found to have capabilities in both the prevention and treatment of inflammatory conditions.
1734,1735,1736
Regulation of Dietary Supplements, 
Nutraceuticals and Functional Foods
Unlike pharmaceuticals, which are significantly 
regulated by the FDA, dietary supplements do not require FDA approval.
1737,1738 Marketers 
are allowed to make statements about the potential health benefits of the supplement, however, the following qualifier is required: “This statement has not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.”
1739 (According 
to a 2019 review of labeling impacts on consumer behavior in The Journal of Alternative 
and Complementary Medicine , “Many consumers 
did not regularly read product labels, nor understand the information they read on those labels.”
1740) The lack of regulation has led 
to the production and sale of supplements that do not always contain the ingredients and quantities that the labels say they do.
1741,1742 Third party groups, such as United 
States Pharmacopeia (USP) and NSF International,
1743,1744 have thus stepped in to 
test various dietary supplements (including vitamins, minerals, herbal supplements, and others) and verify what exactly is in them.
1745,1746 Consumers therefore are 
encouraged to take special caution when choosing to take dietary supplements.
1747
Furthermore, as mentioned earlier in this report, the terms “nutraceutical” and “functional food” have no formal definitions from the FDA.
1748,1749 Instead, these products 
are regulated as drugs, dietary supplements, or foods, depending on their ingredients and intended use.
1750 As researchers for the the 
British Journal of Pharmacology wrote in 2016:
150   PART III  Food as Medicine: Interventions, Programs, Policies and Practices   PART III  Food as Medicine: Interventions, Programs, Policies and Practices   151more informed decisions about the treatments 
they pursue for their specific condition,1751 but 
the regulations have received criticism from Canada’s food industry for potentially stifling innovation.
1752
In the European Union, discussions are ongoing in the European Parliament (EP) as to whether nutraceuticals are medicinal products, defined  by the legislative body as 
“any substance or combination of substances presented as having properties for treating or preventing disease in human beings.”
1753 The 
debate is not regarding whether food products can have beneficial impacts on human health or not, but whether they have sufficient medical properties for that to be considered their primary function.
1754 Lex Mundi, a 
worldwide network of independent law firms, released a report in 2012 outlining policy 
regulations of food supplements in various countries around the world.
1755
In 2005, the Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC), established by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO), developed the “ Guidelines for Vitamin 
and Mineral Food Supplements ” and adopted 
them into the Codex Alimentarius,
1756,1757 an 
international collection of standards, guidelines and codes of practice about food and food safety.
1758 (See Part 2 to learn more about the 
Codex Alimentarius.)
According to a 2018 review  in the Annual 
Review of Public Health , the “Guidelines 
for Vitamin and Mineral Food Supplements” 
“apply only to supplements that contain vitamins and/or minerals where these products are regulated as foods, and they address the composition of supplements, including their safety, purity, and bioavailability.”
1759 Note that 
these guidelines do not include regulations for products such as functional foods, herbal supplements, fatty acids, or amino acids. The The terms “nutraceutical” and “functional 
food” are often used interchangeably and have no legal definition in most countries. These products are intended to have health benefits in addition to their basic nutritional value and usually contain ingredients which are referred to as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) in the United States and elsewhere and as qualified presumption of safety (QPS) in the European Union (EU).
1760
The lack of standards and regulations has 
led to the dissemination of misinformation by supplement companies and confusion among consumers.
1761,1762 In 2019, the FDA issued a 
warning to 12 dietary supplement companies, telling them to stop making claims that their products could cure various diseases, most notably Alzheimer’s.
1763 Scott Gottlieb, MD, 
former commissioner of the FDA, said about the warning, “[U]nproven supplements that claim to treat the disease but offer no benefits can prevent patients from seeking otherwise effective care.”
1764
Warnings such as these shed light on the need for stricter regulation in this industry.
1765
Establishing standards for testing and proving the safety and efficacy of dietary supplements, nutraceuticals and functional foods is critical to advancing the research into their potential as treatments for disease alongside conventional pharmaceuticals.
1766,1767
Such peer-reviewed scientific research and governmental regulation would also help to distinguish legitimate claims made for the efficacy of these types of treatments from unsubstantiated claims made on behalf of dietary supplements.
1768
Conversations about the regulation of functional foods and nutraceuticals are not limited to the United States.
1769 In Canada, 
functional foods and nutraceuticals such as probiotics or herbal supplements are regulated as “natural health products.”
1770 These 
regulations exist to help consumers make guidelines define vitamin and mineral food supplements as products that:
…derive their nutritional relevance 
primarily from the minerals and/or vitamins they contain. Vitamin and mineral food supplements are sources in concentrated forms of those nutrients alone or in combinations, marketed in forms such as capsules, tablets, powders, solutions, etc., that are designed to be taken in measured small-unit quantities but are not in a conventional food form and whose purpose is to supplement the intake of vitamins and/or minerals from the normal diet.
1771
These Guidelines were developed to 
establish international agreement about the composition, packaging, and labeling of vitamin and mineral supplements.
1772 However, 
the Codex Alimentarius has no regulatory power, and therefore countries are not obligated to enforce any guidelines included in it.
1773 Still, at the time, American consumers 
were concerned, as a result of these concerns, the FDA gave assurances that the adoption of the Guidelines for Vitamin and Mineral Food Supplements “will not restrict U.S. consumers’ access to vitamin and mineral supplements or impose any restrictions that go beyond those established by U.S. law.”
1774
In a review of nutraceutical regulation for the British Journal of Pharmacology , researchers 
from the University of Napoli Federico II, the Italian Medicine Agency, and the University of Miami write:
...a restructuring of the entire regulatory 
framework of dietary supplements in view of the role of nutraceuticals is deemed necessary to first give credit to their different purposes and definition, and second, to assess their specific role in the prevention and treatment of pathological conditions, supporting their potential medical use in prevention and therapy only when proven by sound scientific and clinical data.
1775Clear definitions and regulation of functional 
foods and nutraceuticals will help improve consumer understanding of the effects of their food choices on their health while simultaneously promoting the expansion of evidence-based food as medicine practices and programs.
1776
Furthermore, there are three other types of FOSHU: Qualified (scientific evidence is minimal and has not met the standard for an approved FOSHU), Standardized (functional attributes of ingredients in a product have already been approved as individual FOSHU, and the foods therefore do not always require clinical trials), and reduction of disease risk (there is sufficient clinical evidence that a certain food or ingredient is connected to lowered risk of a certain disease).
1777
Since 2012, more than 1,000 products have consistently held an approved FOSHU label.
1778,1779 FOSHUs can be approved 
for certain specified uses: changing gastrointestinal health, lowering blood cholesterol, regulating blood sugar levels, impacting blood pressure, assisting in dental hygiene, aiding in mineral absorption, and encouraging bone growth.
1780,1781,1782
Japan has one of the lowest rates of obesity and highest average lifespans in the world,
1783,1784 and some researchers 
have argued that diet play a role in these statistics.
1785,1786,1787 “We need to increase the 
evidence base of the impact of the whole Japanese dietary lifestyle on health as well as having specific studies on the functionality and health benefits of individual food items,” said Eriko Komiya, Director of Food Cultures Office in the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture Forestry and Fisheries, in an article
for Nature.
1788152   PART III  Food as Medicine: Interventions, Programs, Policies and Practices   PART III  Food as Medicine: Interventions, Programs, Policies and Practices   153[The] FDA narrowly defines the conditions 
under which a medical food may be marketed:
1. It must be a specially formulated and 
processed product (as opposed to a naturally occurring foodstuff used in its natural state) for the partial or exclusive feeding of a patient by means of oral intake or enteral feeding by tube;
2. It must be intended for the dietary 
management of a patient who, because of therapeutic or chronic medical needs, has limited or impaired capacity to ingest, digest, absorb, or metabolize ordinary foodstuffs or certain nutrients, or 
who has other special medically determined nutrient requirements, the dietary management of which cannot be achieved by the modification of the normal diet alone;
3. It must provide nutritional support 
specifically modified for the management of the unique nutrient needs that result from the specific disease or condition, as determined by medical evaluation;
4. It must be intended to be used under 
medical supervision; and
5. It must be intended only for a 
patient receiving active and ongoing medical supervision wherein the patient requires medical care on a recurring basis for, among other things, instructions on the use of the medical food.
In terms of ingredients that may be used in 
medical foods, the ingredients should be either (1) a food additive used in accordance with FDA’s food additive Medical Foods
Medical foods are defined by the FDA as foods 
“formulated to be consumed or administered enterally under the supervision of a physician and which [are] intended for the specific dietary management of a disease or condition for which distinctive nutritional requirements, based on recognized scientific principles, are established by medical evaluation.”
1789 These 
foods are exempt from usual health claim regulation for foods, and the FDA does not maintain a comprehensive list of approved medical foods.
1790
Medical foods are meant to be consumed under the supervision of a physician by patients who have “limited or impaired capacity to ingest, digest, absorb, or metabolize ordinary foodstuffs or certain nutrients, or who has other special medically determined nutrient requirements, the dietary management of which cannot be achieved by the modification of the normal diet alone.”
1791
Generally, though, medical foods do not require a prescription to be purchased; instead, health insurance companies might require a physician’s order or issuance in order to cover the cost of the product.
1792 According 
to the book Developing New Functional Food and Nutraceutical Products: regulations; (2) a color additive used 
in accordance with the color additive regulations; (3) a substance that is generally recognized, by qualified experts, to be safe under the conditions of its intended use (GRAS); or (4) a substance that is authorized by a prior sanction issued by FDA.
1793
Some examples of medical foods include 
formulas for enteral administration (feeding tubes)
1794 and infant formula.1795Today’s 
Dietitian  provides further examples:●products with a full complement of nutrients except the offending nutrient (eg, phenylalanine or tyrosine), including Lofenalac, Ketonex-2, or Propimex;
●modular products, such as ready-to-drink beverages, tablets, and amino acid mixtures, including GlutarAde and Foltx.
1796
Food Interventions, Reimbursement, and 
Health Insurance
From the late 2000s to the early 2010s, 
health insurers have come under scrutiny for spending less on care and more on lobbying and marketing costs in order to increase profits.
1797,1798,1799,1800 The Affordable Care 
Act, passed in 2010, attempted to curtail this trend by requiring that companies spend 80 percent of premiums they receive on patient claims.
1801,1802,1803,1804,1805 Many companies have 
responded by simply raising their premiums, thus increasing the amount of money they get to keep for administrative uses and as profit.
1806 Health insurers have also been 
implicated in agreements with client hospitals that set inflated rates for medical care, causing the United States to spend more on health care per person than any other developed nation, according to statistics from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, an international economic organization with 35 member states.
1807 And, 
in another alarming trend, the COVID-19 pandemic has seen many of the nation’s largest insurance companies, including Humana, Anthem, and UnitedHealth Group, double their earnings.
1808Some insurance plans, well aware of the healthcare costs associated with poor diet, have started to include financial coverage for food interventions, including meals and groceries.
1809,1810,1811 “[I]nsurers... have to 
accurately predict how much the people they insure will cost. That way they can set premiums to cover those costs,” wrotejournalist Marshall Allan for NPR.
1812 Since the 
Affordable Care Act requires health insurance companies to spend at least 80 percent of premiums on care (rather than administrative costs),
1813 higher healthcare costs (resulting 
from rising rates of diet-related disease) could complicate these calculations for some insurance companies and cut into their profits.
1814
Numerous health insurers across the country have begun coverage for food interventions, such as home-delivered meals, healthy grocery stipends, and nutrition education.
1815,1816 Food interventions 
provided through the healthcare system can help patients manage their chronic disease while simultaneously addressing food insecurity.
1817,1818 “[F]inancial support for food is 
medicine interventions in the healthcare 154   PART III  Food as Medicine: Interventions, Programs, Policies and Practices   PART III  Food as Medicine: Interventions, Programs, Policies and Practices   155system might be effective and expedient ways 
to improve both food insecurity and health, even if they do not comprehensively tackle the root structural causes of suboptimal diet,” write researchers led by Sarah Downer, Clinical Instructor at the Center for Health Law and Policy Innovation of Harvard Law School and Director of the Center’s Whole Person Care Initiative, for the BMJ.
1819 The authors note that 
this financial support can come from health insurers: 
In the U.S., government and private health 
insurers are adopting food and nutrition interventions in the hope of a return on their investment due to reductions in high expenditure healthcare claims. In light of emerging evidence, policy makers are experimenting with loosening the parameters of value based or capitated payment structures to allow public insurance money to be spent on food is medicine interventions. This flexibility can be expanded, administratively or through legislation, to all public health insurance programmes. However, large scale uptake of newly created flexibility to pay for food depends on confidence that food is medicine interventions are clinically effective and cost effective compared with other aspects of medical care.
1820
Access to nutritious food is considered a social 
determinant of health by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Healthy People 2030.
1821 (According  to the U.S. 
Department of Health and Human Services: “Social determinants of health [SDOH] are the conditions in the environments where people are born, live, learn, work, play, worship, and age that affect a wide range of health, functioning, and quality-of-life outcomes and risks.”
1822) Therefore, covering the cost 
of nutritious food may be a way for health insurance companies to reduce clients’ health care costs by improving their food security and, ultimately, their health.
1823,1824,1825Conflicts of Interest: Health 
Insurance Companies and the Fast Food Industry
It is also important to note the significant 
financial investments that some health and life insurers have in the fast food industry.
1826
A 2010 study in the American Journal of Public Health  found that insurers such as 
Metlife (life, dental, disability, and critical illness insurance), Prudential (life insurance), New York Life (life insurance), Northwestern Mutual (life, disability, and long-term care insurance), among others, have millions of dollars in holdings in fast food companies such as McDonald’s, Jack in the Box, and Burger King.
1827 Frequent fast food consumption has 
been linked to poor health and increased risk of diet-related disease such as diabetes and obesity.
1828,1829,1830 In the journal Nutrition 
Reviews  in 2013, researchers wrote:
Consumption of takeaway and fast 
food has been shown to have adverse health effects, and while the majority of studies on this subject have focused on the relationship between fast food consumption and weight gain,
1831,1832,1833
more frequent consumption of meals prepared outside of the home has also been observed to correspond with increased risk of insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, elevated total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels as well as decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) concentrations.
1834,1835,1836 Takeaway or 
fast food consumers are characterized by higher intakes of energy, fat, saturated fatty acids (SFAs), trans fatty acids (TFAs), added sugar and sodium, and lower intakes of fiber, macronutrients, and vitamins in comparison to those who do not eat food prepared outside the home.
1837,1838,1839,1840,1841
Wes Boyd, MD, PhD, a professor of Medical 
Ethics and Psychiatry at Baylor College of Medicine, and one of the co-authors of the aforementioned American Journal of Public 
Health study , said, “If the insurance industry 
is willing to invest in products known to be harmful and/or kill people then, prima facie, this is not an industry that actually cares about health and well-being.”
1842 Spokespeople for 
some of the companies mentioned in the article disputed the claims.
1843
The authors concluded that there are two ethical options for insurers to consider regarding their investments:
The first is to divest themselves of holdings 
in fast food companies as well as other industries that have a clearly negative public health impact. Socially responsible investment funds have shown that profits are not incompatible with social good.
A second option is that insurers could 
mitigate the harms of fast food by leveraging their positions as owners of fast food companies to force the adoption of practices consistent with widely accepted public health principles. Such moves could include encouraging companies to improve the nutritional quality of their products, reduce calorie density, serve smaller portions, and change marketing practices. To maximize their impact, insurers might turn over their proxy votes to an independent nonprofit organization that could pool votes in a way that effects meaningful change.
1844
Health Insurance Plans Adopting 
Food as Medicine Programs
Several health insurers, both public and 
private, have incorporated food as medicine coverage in their plans. See below for a list of programs and plans that include food interventions.Medicaid: Numerous state Medicaid programs 
have incorporated food interventions in their coverage, including Virginia, Michigan, and North Carolina.
1845 In Virginia, various 
Medicaid Managed Care programs include benefits such as home-delivered meals and free transportation to farmers’ markets and grocery stores.
1846 Michigan has a policy that 
requires their Medicaid contractors to measure and report on food access for clients, as well as provide resources to clients to help them access food.
1847 North Carolina’s Medicaid 
program includes an initiative called “Healthy Opportunities,” which provides funding to various non-medical pilot programs to improve health, including food interventions such as healthy food boxes, fruit and vegetable prescriptions, healthy meals, and medically tailored meals.
1848,1849
Medicare Advantage: As of 2019, more than 20 million people were enrolled in a Medicare Advantage program (sometimes called “Part C” or “MA Plans”), a type of health insurance that provides Medicare benefits through contracting a private health insurance company.
1850 According to the Kaiser Family 
Foundation, almost half (46 percent) of 
Medicare Advantage plans offer some type of meal benefits,
1851 such as nutrition education, 
cooking classes, or meal delivery.1852 These 
nutrition related programs are part of Medicare Advantage’s attempt to increase their available “health-related benefits” in order to improve patient health and lifestyle before they even go to the doctor.
1853 One study of these 
programs in the journal Health Affairs found 
that participants in a meal delivery program required fewer emergency health services.
1854
Oscar Health: At the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, Oscar Health reported that 30 percent of their Medicare Advantage customers had food supply problems, and they responded to this obstacle by arranging complimentary grocery deliveries from local 156   PART III  Food as Medicine: Interventions, Programs, Policies and Practices   PART III  Food as Medicine: Interventions, Programs, Policies and Practices   157grocery stores.1855 The insurer acknowledges 
the steep costs of hospital visits and believes 
that training people to eat a more nutritious diet is a cheaper alternative to costly medical care.
1856 Ananth Lalithakumar, an executive at 
Oscar Health, stated that, “We’ve seen time and again, the lack of food and nutritional food causes members to get readmitted” to hospitals.
1857
Health Partner Plans: In 2015, Health Partners Plans (HPP), a Philadelphia-based insurance company, piloted a medically tailored meal program among 30 people who were living with diabetes.
1858 The 30 
enrollees received three meals per day and were supported by phone by case managers. The results were so successful that HPP transformed the pilot into an established program.
1859 As of July 2018, the program had 
delivered 610,500 meals to more than 2,400 members, more than 13 percent of whom were people with diabetes. Tracking outcomes, they found that hospital admissions dropped nearly 28 percent, emergency room visits nearly 7 percent, primary care visits nearly 16 percent, and visits to specialists over 7 percent.
1860 As 
of November 17, 2021, Health Partners Plans and Metropolitan Area Neighborhood Nutrition Alliance delivered one million medically tailored meals to its Medicaid members.
1861
Healthfirst and MetroPlus: In early 2021, Healthfirst, one of the nation’s largest not-for-profit health insurers, partnered with the NYC-based nonprofit GrowNYC to allow members of certain Medicare Advantage dual-eligible plans to purchase fresh fruits and vegetables at farmers’ markets run by GrowNYC.
1862,1863 Members can use cards 
provided by Healthfirst to purchase coupons that can then be used for the purchase of any fruits and vegetables at GrowNYC markets. The nonprofit has also made these coupons available to members of MetroPlus Medicare.
1864Humana:  Health insurance company 
Humana has a few programs that integrate food and medicine. In an interview with the Associated Press, Andrew Renda, MD, MPH, Vice President of Bold Goal and Population Health Strategy at Humana, said that there 
is research demonstrating that diabetes patients make visits to the emergency room when access to food is difficult: “It may be because they’re still taking their medications but don’t have enough food, so that their blood sugar goes crazy and then they end up in the hospital.”
1865 One of the programs offered by 
Humana to address this problem is called the Well Dine program: 
Well Dine delivers fully prepared, nutritious 
meals to eligible Humana Medicare-covered patients recovering at home from an inpatient stay in a hospital or skilled nursing facility (SNF) or enrolled in a qualified chronic-condition special needs plan (SNP), dual-eligible SNP or Illinois Medicare-Medicaid plan. Patients also receive a guide to nutrition and eating well.
Meals are provided by a Humana vendor 
and delivered by FedEx or UPS. Post-discharge meals must be ordered within 30 days of the patient’s post-discharge date. The number of meals provided depends on the patient’s plan benefits. There may be a limit to how many times the benefit can be used each year.
Patients who are eligible for the chronic-
condition meals program receive 20 meals designed to support their special dietary needs. Patients with multiple conditions can receive 20 meals per eligible condition during the plan year. Eligible conditions may include congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, and diabetes.
1866
Another program offered by Humana is the Healthy Foods Card, which allows members to purchase approved foods (including perishable foods, nonperishable foods, frozen foods, and beverages) from specific retailers.
1867 The 
card acts like a debit card loaded with $25 or $50 per month.
1868 This benefit is available to 
enrollees in Humana’s Medicare Advantage plans. 
Blue Cross Blue Shield:  Health Care 
Service Corporation, the parent company of 
Blue Cross Blue Shield in Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Montana, and Illinois, launched a prepared meal delivery pilot program, called FoodQ, for residents of 25 Illinois zip codes and 15 Dallas zip codes.
1869 Many of 
the residents of the chosen zip codes have difficulty accessing nutritious food because of transportation barriers or a lack of availability of nutritious foods in their communities.
1870
Recipients could purchase meals for $5-$10 each, and pay a $10 per month subscription fee to avoid delivery charges.
1871 The program 
ran for six months in 2019; however, at the time of publication (February 2022) the FoodQ website is not operational.
1872
Blue Shield of California:  In 2021, health 
insurance company Blue Shield of California (an independent member of the Blue Shield Association) expanded its Wellvolution lifestyle program (a platform that connects participants with curated programs to manage a “healthy lifestyle,” such as weight loss, mental health, and smoking)
1873 to include nutrition support for 
members living with type 2 diabetes.1874 Low-
income members of Blue Shield are eligible to receive six months of free diabetes-friendly meals provided by health care company Betr Health.
1875,1876
158   PART III  Food as Medicine: Interventions, Programs, Policies and Practices   PART III  Food as Medicine: Interventions, Programs, Policies and Practices   159Government Support for Food as Medicine
In addition to health care organizations, some 
policymakers and legislators have introduced and supported food as medicine programs on local, state, and federal levels. In 2019, the Center for Health Law & Policy Innovation at Harvard Law School and medically-tailored meal nonprofit Community Servings released the Massachusetts Food is Medicine State Plan.
1877 Sponsored by State Senator Julian 
Cyr (D-MA) and State Representative Denise Garlick (D-MA), the plan advocated for the Office of Medicaid (MassHealth) to create a food and health pilot program that would connect Medicaid enrollees with diet-related diseases to community-based nutrition organizations.
1878 The authors of the plan 
estimate that food insecurity, hunger, mental health and the physical health conditions to which they contribute currently cost the state of Massachusetts approximately $1.9 billion annually.
1879 The goal of the program would 
be to reduce those costs while also achieving better health outcomes for patients.
1880,1881
Interest and action surrounding the use of food as medicine has also reached the federal level. In January 2018, the House of Representatives created a bipartisan Food is Medicine Working Group led by Representatives Jim McGovern (D-MA), Chellie Pingree (D-ME), Roger Marshall (R-KS), and Jackie Walorski (R-IN) whose purpose is to draw attention to hunger and address its impacts on health.
1882 One of 
the Food is Medicine Working Group’s  key goals is to shape policy that would secure medically tailored meals made with fresh fruits and vegetables for more chronically-ill Americans. “We simply cannot address hunger and health as two separate issues,” said McGovern at an event celebrating the program’s launch, “They’re two sides of the same coin.”
1883 Over the few years since its 
launch, the group has made notable progress. In 2020, it introduced the Medically Tailored Home-Delivered Meal Demonstration Pilot Act, which, if passed, would establish a 3-year pilot program assessing the impact of providing MTMs to vulnerable older adults through Medicare.
1884,1885
As the momentum behind using nutrition as a tool for improving public health builds, universities have begun working with policymakers to devise healthier federal food programs.
1886 Tufts University’s Food is 
Medicine Public Impact Initiative  is a notable 
example of this type of collaboration.1887 Led 
by faculty at the Gerald J. and Dorothy R. Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy, the oldest and largest graduate school of nutrition in North America, the initiative aims to “raise awareness of the tremendous impact of food on national well-being... and provide trusted science on actionable and impactful solutions.”
1888 In conjunction with 
Congressional leaders, community advocates, and industry stakeholders, the researchers hope to create policy solutions that improve nutrition for all Americans, reduce the cost of their care, and mitigate health inequities by using food as medicine.

Alzheimer’s
According to the National Institutes of Health National Institute on Aging  (NIA):
Alzheimer’s disease is a brain disorder that 
slowly destroys memory and thinking skills and, eventually, the ability to carry out the simplest tasks. In most people with the disease—those with the late-onset type symptoms first appear in their mid-60s. Early-onset Alzheimer’s occurs between a person’s 30s and mid-60s and is very rare. Alzheimer’s disease is the most common cause of dementia among older adults.
1900Common Dietary Interventions
Facets of the ketogenic and Mediterranean diets are among the most common dietary changes used as part of a treatment plan for many diet-related diseases
1901,1902,1903,1904
and are referenced often in the following section.
The ketogenic diet was first introduced in the early 1920s as a treatment for epilepsy 
and has also been examined in the treatment of a variety of diet-related health conditions.
1905 The ketogenic diet is a low carbohydrate, high fat diet that focuses on 
replacing carbohydrates and sugars your body can break down easily (such as white bread and soda) with a moderate amount of proteins (e.g grass-fed beef and free-range poultry) and a high amount of healthy fats (e.g. avocado).
19061907,1908,1909  While there is 
not a standard macronutrient profile for the ketogenic diet, “The dietary macronutrients are divided into approximately 55% to 60% fat, 30% to 35% protein, and 5% to 10% carbohydrates. Specifically, in a 2000 kcal per day diet, carbohydrates amount up to 20 to 50 g per day.”
1910 This mix of macronutrients aims to induce ketosis, a metabolic state 
in which your body uses fat for fuel instead of carbohydrates.
The Mediterranean diet consists of foods that are consumed in regions surrounding 
the Mediterranean Sea, including local, fresh produce; extra virgin olive oil; small amounts of cheese, yogurt and red meat; fish and poultry; desserts made up of fresh fruit; and moderate amounts of wine consumed with meals.
1911,1912 The Mediterranean 
diet is included on the United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)’s list of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.
1913 According to The 
Mediterranean Diet, the website charged with “safeguard[ing] and promot[ing] the Mediterranean Diet at the regional, national and international level,”
1914 followers of the 
diet should use the official diet pyramid, which “places at the base foods of plant origin that provide key nutrients and other protective substances that contribute to general well-being and to maintain a balanced diet.”
1915164   PART IV  Food as Medicine: Treating and Managing Disease   PART IV  Food as Medicine: Treating and Managing Disease   165
Estimates from experts suggest that more than 
6 million Americans over the age of 65 might have Alzheimer’s,
1916 and the Alzheimer’s 
Association projects this number to grow to nearly 14 million by 2050.
1917 Alzheimer’s 
disease is characterized by a “loss of cognitive functioning — thinking, remembering, and reasoning — to such an extent that it interferes with a person’s daily life and activities.”
1918
The NIA states that the Mediterranean diet (high in fish, whole grains, vegetables, and olive oil while low in red meat consumption) has been associated with cognitive benefits  in reducing the risk and effects of Alzheimer’s.
1919
A 2021 study in Neurology  showed that the Mediterranean diet could act as a protective measure against memory decline in older adults at high risk of developing Alzheimer’s (researchers cited the following risk factors for Alzheimer’s: relatives with Alzheimer’s, subjective cognitive decline, and mild cognitive impairment).
1920 In a 2020 study appearing 
in Alzheimer’s & Dementia, older individuals (age 50-85) were given cognition tests and food frequency questionnaires to determine the connections between dietary intake and cognitive function.
1921 In the study, researchers 
found that participants whose diets were most similar to the Mediterranean diet scored higher on cognition tests.

Hypertension) diet  has been shown to 
lower high blood pressure, a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease.
1923 The DASH diet 
includes: “Eating vegetables, fruits, and whole grains; including fat-free or low-fat dairy products, fish, poultry, beans, nuts, and vegetable oils; limiting foods that are high in saturated fat, such as fatty meats, full-fat dairy products, and tropical oils such as coconut, palm kernel, and palm oils; and limiting sugar-sweetened beverages and sweets.”
1924
The MIND (Mediterranean–DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay) diet combines elements of both the DASH diet and the Mediterranean diet. Similarly to those diets, the MIND diet emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, beans and certain fish.
1925
The diet focuses on plant-based foods linked to dementia prevention. According to the NIA, the MIND diet emphasizes eating from 10 healthy food groups as follows: 
●Leafy green vegetables, at least 6 servings/week
●Other vegetables, at least 1 serving/day
●Berries, at least 2 servings/week
●Whole grains, at least 3 servings/day
●Fish, 1 serving/week
●Poultry, 2 servings/week
●Beans, 3 servings/week
●Nuts, 5 servings/week
●Wine, 1 glass/day
●Olive oil
●[Set limits for] red meat, sweets, cheese, butter/margarine and fast/fried food.
1926
168   PART IV  Food as Medicine: Treating and Managing Disease   PART IV  Food as Medicine: Treating and Managing Disease   169According to the NIA, “Evidence supporting 
the MIND diet comes from observational studies of more than 900 dementia-free older adults, which found that closely following the MIND diet was associated with a reduced risk of Alzheimer’s disease and a slower rate of cognitive decline.”
1927 A forthcoming 3-year 
study will examine the impact of these diets on brain health and cognitive decline among older adults with a family history of dementia or Alzheimer’s.
1928 The study is supported by 
the MIND Diet Intervention, a collaboration between Rush University, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Brigham & Women’s Hospital, and the National Institute on Aging.
1929
There is a plethora of research demonstrating that oily fish (e.g., salmon) is associated with lower cognitive decline and higher brain function.
1930,1931,1932,1933,1934,1935,1936,1937 This could 
be due to the omega-3 fatty acids in fish, nutrients present in high quantities in the brain.
1938 In a 2018 study of patients diagnosed 
with Alzheimer’s at varying levels of severity appearing in the Journal of Alzheimer’s 
Disease , dietary intervention in the form of 
fish oil intake was associated with slower progression of the disease, including improved memory, sight, and mood.
1939 In 2019, another 
study appearing in PLoS One concluded 
that fish oil supplementation might have neuroprotective effects when taken during the presymptomatic stage of Alzheimer’s.
1940
Some studies have demonstrated the ketogenic diet to be a potentially effective therapy in both the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer’s.
1941,1942,1943,1944 In one study
published in Alzheimer’s Research & Therapy
in 2021, researchers found that a 12-week modified ketogenic diet (macronutrient ratio of 58% fat, 29% protein, 7% fiber, and 6% net carbohydrate by weight) significantly improved total quality of life and daily function among patients with clinically confirmed Alzheimer’s .
1945 Specifically, memory retention 
rates, adherence, and safety were all more achievable in Alzheimer’s patients who were on the ketogenic diet.
1946
When designing dietary changes for patients managing Alzheimer’s, there are other variables that need to be considered to ensure that food is both appealing and easy to eat.
1947 Cognitive decline in 
patients with Alzheimer’s has been linked to masticatory function decline,
1948 which 
means that they often have difficulty chewing. Loss of appetite is also common among Alzheimer’s patients.
1949 Furthermore, many 
medications prescribed to treat Alzheimer’s have side effects that adversely affect the gastrointestinal system.
1950 While the triggers 
for gastrointestinal pain and discomfort vary widely among different people,
1951 some 
studies have shown that intake of dietary fiber (often from fruits and vegetables) might help patients who are experiencing gastrointestinal discomfort.
1952,1953,1954
Current evidence about the connection between diet and Alzheimer’s risk is not as strong as evidence for other types of lifestyle interventions, such as physical activity and cognitive testing.
1955 However, research 
into the effects of various types of foods and dietary interventions on brain health is still ongoing,
1956 as well as the risk factors 
associated with obesity, alcohol consumption, and smoking.

Arthritis, Non-Rheumatoid
According to the National Institutes of 
Health National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases  (NIAMS), 
“‘Arthritis’ literally means joint inflammation. Although joint inflammation is a symptom or sign rather than a specific diagnosis, the term arthritis is often used to refer to any disorder that affects the joints. Joints are located in -places where two bones meet, such as your elbow or knee.”
1958 Arthritis refers to more 
than 100 different diseases characterized by joint pain, swelling, and stiffness; this includes osteoarthritis, gout, psoriatic arthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis, among others.
1959,1960
Arthritis can affect people of any age, sex, and race, but is most prevalent among women and older people.
1961
Osteoarthritis
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), osteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis caused by damage or breakdown of joint cartilage between bones.
1962 In some studies, the 
Mediterranean diet has been shown to help alleviate pain for people with osteoarthritis due to its anti-inflammatory effects.
1963,1964,1965,1966,1967
Eating a diet that is high in fiber such as vegetables, beans, whole grains and fruit has been associated with decreased inflammation. In two long-term observational studies  of 
individuals with knee osteoarthritis published in Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases , 
researchers found that higher total fiber intake correlates with lower prevalence of the disease.
1968
Consumption of various fruits and fruit extracts, especially berries high in antioxidants (such as blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries), may reduce pain and inflammation; according to a 2019 review  in 
Food & Function, “on the basis of emerging pre-clinical, epidemiological and clinical data, blueberries, raspberries and strawberries, as well as pomegranates are among the commonly available fruits that may offer some protection against arthritis.”
1969 In one 
2015 study published in the journal Arthritis,
a whole-food, plant-based (WFPB) diet was found to reduce pain for osteoarthritis patients:
The primary mechanism by which diet 
reduces subjective pain may be a result of normalization of the fatty acid profile and reduction in exposure to inflammatory protein precursors. Western diets are high in arachidonic acid, which are modified into proinflammatory prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs work to reduce pain by limiting the metabolism of arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is found in animal foods and some vegetable oils. Therefore, the adoption of a WFPB will dramatically reduce the availability of precursors necessary to produce painful prostaglandins.
1970
To treat osteoarthritis, some patients turn to 
dietary supplements, including glucosamine and chondroitin, which are described by the National Institutes of Health National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) as “structural components of cartilage, the tissue that cushions the joints.”
1971 While these components are 
found naturally in the body, they are also available as over-the-counter dietary supplements.
1972 Glucosamine in particular 
has received attention as being able to reduce the symptoms of osteoarthritis of the knee;
1973 however, most major studies 
of the supplement’s effects (on knees as well as other joints) have had conflicting results.
1974,1975,1976,1977,1978,1979,1980,1981,1982 In 
2008, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) conducted a large-scale, multicenter clinical 
trial published in   Journal of Pain & Palliative 
Care Pharmacotherapy  testing the efficacy of 
glucosamine and chondroitin supplements in treating knee osteoarthritis and found:172   PART IV  Food as Medicine: Treating and Managing Disease   PART IV  Food as Medicine: Treating and Managing Disease   173
For a subset of participants with 
moderate-to-severe pain, glucosamine combined with chondroitin sulfate provided statistically significant pain relief compared with placebo—about 79 percent had a 20 percent or greater reduction in pain versus about 54 percent for placebo... For participants in the mild pain subset, glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate together or alone did not provide statistically significant pain relief.
1983
The NCCIH notes that some European 
studies of glucosamine have reported positive effects of the supplement on knee pain and function.
1984
Gout
Osteoarthritis can predispose the depositing of monosodium urate crystals into joint sites, leading to gout, which is another type of arthritis.
1985,1986 Gout is characterized by 
sudden and severe pain localized to one or more joints, but is most commonly found in the big toe.
1987,1988 Consumption of high-fructose 
corn syrup (which is prominent in Western diets) can lead to a buildup of uric acid, which causes gout.
1989 Other dietary risk factors for 
gout include a high consumption of meat and alcohol.
1990,1991,1992 The management of gout 
focuses primarily on medical treatment, but diet can also play a significant role.
1993 The 
body makes uric acid when it breaks down purines; therefore the intake of foods high in purine, such as meat, beer, bread, and certain legumes, might increase the frequency of gout flares.
1994 Research has also shown 
that increased intake of fruits, especially cherries, can help prevent gout flares.
1995
Clerodendranthus spicatus, often referred to as “Kidney tea,” an herbal remedy used in Traditional Chinese Medicine, may have the potential to reduce pain and swelling when taken during a gout flare-up.
1996Ankylosing spondylitis
Ankylosing spondylitis is an arthritis of the spine that can cause back pain and stiffness,
1997 and for some people 
gastrointestinal problems.1998,1999,2000,2001 A 
2010 study of 165 adults in Sweden with ankylosing spondylitis, published in Clinical 
Rheumatology , found that gastrointestinal pain 
was more prevalent in those who reported high consumption of vegetables and less prevalent among those who consumed milk and soured milk.
2002 The authors note that 
certain vegetables are high in a collection of short-chain carbohydrates that are not properly absorbed in the gut and hypothesize that “an inappropriate absorption may allow these foodstuffs to reach the distal ileum and colon where they affect the bowel flora, thereby creating the symptoms of an irritable bowel.”
2003 Overall, there are not enough 
studies investigating the relationship between diet and dietary supplements and ankylosing spondylitis.
2004,2005 Despite the lack of published 
research, dietary modifications and vitamin supplementation are still common among ankylosing spondylitis patients.
2006,2007
Psoriatic Arthritis
Psoriatic arthritis is a chronic type of inflammatory arthritis that is linked with psoriasis, an autoimmune condition that causes red and scaly patches on the skin.
2008
Dietary interventions have been found to be an effective supplemental therapy to reduce the severity of psoriatic arthritis.
2009 A 2018 
study published in JAMA Dermatology  of 
158,361 psoriatic arthritis patients suggested that adherence to the Mediterranean diet might result in lower disease activity.
2010 In 
a 2020 study in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology , researchers wrote, 
“[p]atients often ask about the potential for dietary factors, and gluten intake in particular, to modify risk of other inflammatory skin diseases, including psoriasis and atopic dermatitis.”
2011 However, adopting a gluten-free 
diet has yet to be shown effective at treating psoriatic arthritis.
2012,2013,2014174   PART IV  Food as Medicine: Treating and Managing Disease   PART IV  Food as Medicine: Treating and Managing Disease   175Arthritis, Rheumatoid
Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune 
disease in which the immune system attacks healthy cells, causing painful inflammation.
2015,2016 It is characterized by pain, 
stiffness, and swelling in the joints (such as the wrist, hands, feet, spine, knees, and jaw), which can flare up and worsen from time to time.
2017,2018 According to the National Institute 
of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS), risk factors for rheumatoid arthritis include advanced age, smoking, obesity, and gum disease.
2019
Research has demonstrated that eating higher amounts of fish and/or taking fish oil is associated with lower rates of pain and other negative symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis.
2020,2021,2022,2023 The Mediterranean diet 
has been shown to help patients manage rheumatoid pain.
2024 A 2018 study in Clinical 
Nutrition  showed that monounsaturated fatty 
acids (found in olive oil and avocado oil) might be the key nutrients that suppress disease activity.
2025 Some research has also found that 
low-fat plant-based diets reduce rheumatoid arthritis symptoms by eliminating many of the most common triggers.
2026,2027 In a 2020 journal 
article in BMC Rheumatology , researchers 
advised that dietary intervention should not be the sole treatment plan for rheumatoid arthritis, but also noted that dietary choices play a role in disease management, writing, “Adherence to the Mediterranean diet is generally recommended, with a plant-based regimen abundant in wholegrains, legumes, five or more fruit and vegetables per day, preferably seasonal.”
2028 Anti-inflammatory foods have 
potential in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
2029,2030,2031,2032
A 2021 review  in the journal Clinical Nutrition
outlined the ideal “food pyramid” for a person living with rheumatoid arthritis, which included the following: [C]arbohydrates should be consumed 
every day (3 portions of whole grains, preferably gluten free), together with fruits and vegetables (5 portions; among which fruit, berries and citrus fruit are to be preferred, and among the vegetables, green leafy ones.), light yogurt (125 ml), skim milk (200 ml), 1 glass (125 ml) of wine and extra virgin olive oil; weekly, fish (3 portions), white meat (3 portions), legumes (2 portions) eggs (2 portions), seasoned cheeses (2 portions), and red or processed meats (once a week).
2033
While food certainly has an impact, some 
researchers argue that more studies and observation are needed before a concrete dietary recommendation can be made about the relationship between food and rheumatoid arthritis.
2034,2035,2036
Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is another type of autoimmune arthritis that begins in childhood.
2037 The word “idiopathic,” which 
means unknown, refers to researchers’ lack of understanding about what causes JIA.
2038
Like rheumatoid arthritis, JIA is a form of inflammatory arthritis; however, according to the Arthritis Foundation, “it is not a kid version of the adult disease.”
2039 About 5 
percent of children with JIA have a subtype of the disease whose observable physical and biochemical characteristics resemble those of adult rheumatoid arthritis.
2040
While research has not supported a standard diet for the treatment of JIA, parents and families of people with JIA often consider diet a factor contributing to disease activity.
2041,2042,2043,2044 In a 2014 survey of 50 
Finnish children with JIA published in BMC 
Complementary Medicine and Therapies , 
28 percent of respondents reported using dietary restrictions to help manage their condition, although the effects of these dietary changes on the children’s disease activity are unclear.
2045Autism
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a group of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by difficulty communicating and socializing with others, as well as repetitive behaviors and narrow interests.
2046,2047 An estimated 1 in 
110 children have ASD, presenting a range of symptoms varying from mild to severe.
2048 It is 
four times more common in boys than girls.2049
The impact of the disorder on children as they age varies with the severity of their case, the symptoms they present, and the promptness of their diagnosis.
2050 Although the cause of 
ASD remains unknown, early treatment is associated with milder symptoms long-term and overall improvements in quality of life.
2051
Given that few treatments have shown to be effective at mitigating the core symptoms of autism, many patients and their families seek alternative and food-based medicine.
2052
Around 25 percent of people with ASD follow a specialized diet or use dietary supplements to manage their condition.
2053 Gluten-free 
(aims to eliminate wheat, barley, and rye) and casein-free (aims to eliminate milk and dairy products) diets are most common, although clinical studies have been unable to provide sufficient evidence to support the diet as a treatment for ASD.
2054,2055,2056,2057,2058,2059 Due 
to the lack of sufficient clinical studies about these diets, some researchers have explicitly advised against it; in the Journal of Child 
Neurology  in 2014, researchers wrote:
[T]he evidence to support gluten-free, 
casein-free diets is limited and weak, such dietary restrictions being associated with social rejection, stigmatization, deficits in socialization and integration, and a misuse of resources, as well as potential adverse biomedical effects. Hence, we advise against resorting to elimination diets in an attempt to treat autism spectrum disorders. Specifically, until there is conclusive evidence of the benefits of gluten-free, casein-free diets in autism spectrum disorders, they should only be introduced after the diagnosis of an intolerance or allergy to allergens in the foods that would be eliminated in such a diet.
2060
Limited research has been conducted to 
evaluate the impact of a ketogenic diet in the management and treatment of symptoms for ASD.
2061,2062,2063,2064 Studies in which mice were 
fed a ketogenic diet have shown promise in reducing seizures and anxiety, but initial research has yet to rule out other variables such as lower caloric intake resulting from the dietary change as the cause of the reduction in core symptoms.
2065,2066,2067,2068 This reduction 
in anxiety could potentially play a role in normalizing social interactions, which many individuals with ASD struggle with.
2069
Existing studies of the impact of a ketogenic diet on humans with ASD have used small sample sizes, but have demonstrated behavioral improvements in some children with ASD.
2070,2071 The Childhood Autism Rating 
scale is a diagnostic tool used by trained clinicians to rate items indicative of ASD after direct observation.
2072 In a 2018 study
appearing in the journal Physiology & Behaviormonitoring the impact of a modified ketogenic and gluten-free diet on children with autism aged 2 to 17 years, researchers found that “50 percent of subjects showed improvement on [the Childhood Autism Rating Scale, 2nd Edition] scores in the areas of imitation, body use, and fear or nervousness.”
2073 The 
researchers conclude that the ketogenic diet warrants further investigation with larger sample sizes.
2074
Some clinical evidence has shown that children with autism may have abnormally low levels of fatty acids relative to non-autistic children,
2075,2076,2077,2078 and these findings 
have spurred research into omega-3 and omega-6 supplements as treatments.
2079,2080,2081
However, these studies have not produced sufficient evidence associating fatty 176   PART IV  Food as Medicine: Treating and Managing Disease   PART IV  Food as Medicine: Treating and Managing Disease   177
acid supplements with improved ASD 
symptoms.2082,2083,2084,2085,2086 Another dietary 
supplement, sulforaphane (a phytochemical derived from broccoli sprouts), might have a positive impact on irritability among those with ASD.
2087,2088 Clinical trials investigating other 
potential applications of sulforaphane in the treatment of ASD are currently inconclusive but remain ongoing.
2089,2090,2091,2092,2093
Dietary supplements, such as omega-3 fatty acids, zinc, melatonin, and others, have also received significant attention as possible treatments for ASD symptoms.
2094,2095,2096,2097,2098,2099,2100 Some 
clinical studies have resulted in minor behavioral and functional improvements for participants receiving these supplements, but researchers acknowledge that not all people with ASD will respond similarly to dietary supplements.
2101,2102,2103,2104,2105,2106,2107
Other researchers have argued that dietary supplementation is unnecessary for children with ASD because it might lead to excessive intake of certain nutrients, particularly vitamin A, folate and zinc.
2108 This can have 
negative outcomes; for example, excessive intake of vitamin A can lead to side effects such as nausea, headache, fatigue, loss of appetite, psychiatric changes, osteoporosis, and irritability.
2109
Studies analyzing the impacts of herbs used in Traditional Chinese Medicine on the core symptoms of autism have found mixed results.
2110,2111 ,2112,2113 One very small study
(n = 3) conducted in 2009 appearing in the Journal of Dietary Supplements  measured 
the effects of Panax ginseng  on children with 
autism and revealed very slight improvement in measures of irritability, hyperactivity, inadequate eye contact, and inappropriate speech.
2114 However, the author of the study 
concluded: “Since there does not seem to be any significant improvement caused by Panax ginseng , its effect as an add-on 
therapy... requires further investigation. Before knowing its efficacy for adults, Panax 
ginseng  should not be recommended for treating children suffering from autism.” A 2012 randomized controlled trial  in Child Psychiatry 
& Human Development testing the effects of 
Ginkgo biloba  on children with autism also 
did not result in significant improvement in autism symptoms.
2115 However, one 
2012 study published in Evidence-Based 
Complementary and Alternative Medicineshowed that a Traditional Chinese Medicine dietary intervention that emphasized grains, vegetables, fruits, beans, mushrooms, nuts, and root vegetables (while reducing ginger, garlic, green onion, spicy foods, eggs, meat, and fish) resulted in improved executive function among children with ASD.
2116
Children on the autism spectrum are more likely to exhibit nutritional deficiencies than children who do not have ASD.
2117 Selective 
eating, tantrums, inattention at mealtime, and aversion to new foods are all commonly reported in autistic children.
2118,2119 These 
restrictive feeding behaviors are thought to contribute to deficiencies in Vitamin A, Vitamin B6, Vitamin B12, Vitamin C, Vitamin D, calcium, zinc, and fatty acids in autistic youth.
2120,2121,2122,2123,2124,2125,2126 A 2011 study
appearing in Nutrition & Metabolism  has 
suggested that the levels of necessary vitamins, minerals, and plasma amino acids in children with ASD are inversely correlated with the severity of their symptoms, with those managing more serious cases exhibiting more significant malnutrition.
2127
Malnutrition negatively affects cognitive and social development, making it imperative that pediatricians and families find ways to improve the nutrient intake of children with ASD.
2128 Furthermore, malnutrition and vitamin 
deficiencies among children with ASD has been linked to scurvy, bone-thinning, and vision loss.
2129,2130,2131,2132,2133,2134,2135
Food selectivity also leads to an increased prevalence of diet-related diseases among autistic children
2136 who tend to restrict their 
consumption to foods that are high in calories and refined carbohydrates that provide little 178   PART IV  Food as Medicine: Treating and Managing Disease   PART IV  Food as Medicine: Treating and Managing Disease   179nutritional diversity and lead to weight gain 
and obesity.2137,2138,2139,2140,2141,2142 As a result, 
dietary evaluations and feeding interventions to mitigate food selectivity are recommended for all children diagnosed with ASD in order to improve the variety of foods and nutrients consumed among these children.
2143,2144,2145,2146
Children with ASD frequently exhibit gastrointestinal problems, including constipation, gas, and diarrhea.
2147,2148
Research has shown evidence that children with ASD may have alterations of gut microbiota and may create gastrointestinal issues.
2149,2150,2151 Ongoing studies of the gut-
brain axis—the physiological connections between the microbiome in the gut and the brain—have begun to indicate a possible link between the makeup of an individual’s gut flora and the severity of their ASD symptoms.
2152,2153,2154,2155,2156 If such a 
connection is firmly established, there may, in fact, be a role for food-based interventions that alter patients’ gut microbiomes as a means of managing and treating ASD.
2157,2158
Cancer
Cancer is an umbrella term for more than a hundred diseases caused by abnormal cell growth in any part of the body.
2159 The National 
Institutes of Health National Cancer Institute (NCI) emphasizes , “it’s important to know 
there isn’t just one food or special diet that has proved to control cancer.”
2160
The NCI recommends that all cancer patients maintain “healthy eating habits” and incorporate all their needed nutrients into their diets, which can be difficult for patients experiencing loss of appetite, changes in taste, trouble swallowing, and other side effects of cancer treatment.
2161 To help 
patients manage their diet throughout cancer treatment, the NCI compiled a list of dietary changes that can be made to treat various side effects and symptoms of cancer and cancer treatment.
2162 For example, cancer 
patients with changes to their sense of taste are advised to avoid red meat and try high-protein vegetarian recipes instead.
2163
Fruit and vegetable intake is frequently studied for its impact on the prevention, treatment, and recurrence rate of various cancers.
2164,2165,2166,2167,2168,2169,2170 One 2020 
analysis  of 150 colorectal cancer survivors appearing in the British Journal of Nutrition
showed that “[a] higher intake of fruit and vegetables was associated with significantly better physical functioning.”
2171 Furthermore, 
in a 2020 review  published in the journal 
Advances in Nutrition , researchers wrote: 
…the consumption of ~300 g/d of 
vegetables by head and neck cancer patients and ~300 g/d of vegetables and ~300 g/d fruit separately by ovarian cancer patients decreased overall mortality. Moreover, it is important to bear in mind that none of the studies have detected a harmful relation with the consumption of fruit and vegetables in cancer patients.
2172
In a study of 8,927 women with breast cancer 
appearing in Cancer Research  in 2020, 
researchers wrote:
…we observed better overall survival after 
breast cancer diagnosis among women with higher vegetable consumption; specifically, green leafy vegetables as well as cruciferous vegetables, fruits and vegetables high in vitamin C, and vegetables rich in β-carotene. Although eating higher amounts of vegetables may not affect breast cancer-specific mortality, high intake of vegetables and some fruits may improve overall survival. High post-diagnostic fruit juice intake may also be associated with increased risk of death due to breast cancer and all causes, and this finding needs further evaluation.
2173
Additional research supports the role of 
individualized nutrition education in cancer care. One 2018 study published in Annals 
of Behavioral Medicine  demonstrated 
that participation in a 12-week exercise and dietary intervention consisting of individualized nutritional counseling with an emphasis on adopting a plant-based diet resulted in “significant, clinically meaningful improvements in mobility performance, muscular strength, and body composition” among prostate cancer patients.
2174 Another 
2019 study appearing in Nutrition and 
Cancer  showed that individualized nutritional 
education and dietary intervention led to a reduction in negative gastrointestinal side effects from chemotherapy.
2175 Some of the 
recommendations provided to participants included eating frequent small meals and avoiding spicy, fried, sugary or very aromatic foods.
2176
Research has also suggested that the ketogenic diet might be an effective dietary intervention for cancer patients to starve cancerous cells of energy from carbohydrates while normal cells adapt to use ketone bodies (compounds produced during the metabolism of fats) to survive.
2177
Sugar consumption has been connected to cancer occurrence and recurrence in numerous studies,
2178,2179,2180, although findings 
are inconsistent.2181,2182 In one long-term study
appearing in Cancer Prevention Research
of more than 3,000 adults aged 26-84 years, study participants were asked to fill out food frequency questionnaires from 1991 until 1995, and were followed up with until 2013 regarding cancer incidence as confirmed from pathology reports in the patient’s medical record.
2183 The researchers concluded: 
Sugary foods were not associated with the 
risk of any cancer. However, in exploratory stratified analyses, total consumption of sugary beverages was associated with 59 percent higher risk of adiposity-related cancers [cancers related to higher body weight, such as breast, prostate, and colorectal] in participants with excessive central adiposity [excess body fat resulting in a weight circumference greater than 40 inches for men and 35 inches for women].
2184
This is consistent with other studies of the 
relationship between sugar-sweetened beverage consumption and cancer occurrence.
2185,2186 However, researcher 
Mingyang Song, ScD, Assistant Professor of Clinical Epidemiology and Nutrition at Harvard School of Public Health, noted the need for 
additional research into the sugar-cancer connection in the American Journal of Clinical 
Nutrition  in 2020. He wrote:
Like many questions in nutrition, strong 
biological plausibility does not necessarily lead to positive findings in epidemiology. This is particularly true when it comes to the sugar–cancer relation. The reasons are multifaceted and related to the challenges of accurate dietary assessment over a long period of time, adequate control for confounding by other dietary/lifestyle exposures, identification of the most relevant time window for exposure assessment, consideration of potential effect modifications by population characteristics, and heterogeneity between and within cancer types.
2187
In conjunction with medical treatment, a 
tailored nutritious diet can help to counter side effects, repair damaged tissue, and maintain energy levels.
2188 The American Cancer 
Society recommends  that patients going 
through treatment consume more calories and 180   PART IV  Food as Medicine: Treating and Managing Disease   PART IV  Food as Medicine: Treating and Managing Disease   181protein, and snack often.2189 This can include a 
variety of protein-rich snacks such as yogurt, 
cereal and milk, and cheese and crackers.2190
Different cancer treatments can have very different side effects; however, loss of appetite is one of the most common side effects of cancer treatment (including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery) and is the most common cause of malnutrition in cancer patients.
2191 Furthermore, chemotherapy 
treatment often causes alterations in taste and smell, which can lead to changes in food behavior.
2192 A systematic review published in 
Supportive Care Cancer in 2020 found that the 
use of oral nutrition supplements and dietary counseling and increases in EPA (a fatty acid) from fish oil supplementation improved the appetite and nutrition outcomes of patients with cancer undergoing cancer treatments.
2193
Cancer treatment plans are highly individualized to meet the needs of patients, so food as medicine interventions for cancer patients should be equally tailored to specific needs and conditions.
2194,2195,2196 Researchers 
Itziar Tueros, PhD and Matxalen Uriarte, PhD wrote about the need to accommodate changing food preferences among cancer patients in the Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture in 2018:
Taking into account that reduced food 
enjoyment during cancer treatment can give rise to negative physical, emotional and social consequences, taste and smell alterations, food preferences and specific nutritional requirements should be combined and considered by the food industry when designing innovative formulae for cancer patients. The development of new food products or the revision of existing ones is necessary to prevent or tackle malnutrition, being the main challenge in oncological nutrition, as it is a determinant factor for adverse outcomes, including increased morbidity and mortality, and decreased quality of life.
2197An example of a highly individualized dietary 
intervention for cancer treatment can be found at NYU Langone’s Perlmutter Cancer Center in New York City.
2198 The hospital launched a 
program  in 2016 to provide patients with indi-
vidualized home-delivered customized meals that take into account the reasons for their loss of appetite (which might include nausea, de-pression, or difficulty swallowing).
2199
According to the NCI, many cancer patients might seek out complementary medicines, including dietary intervention, to pursue alongside regular treatment for a variety of reasons, including:
●Help coping with the side effects of cancer treatments, such as nausea, pain, and fatigue
●Comforting themselves and ease the worries of cancer treatment and related stress
●Feeling that they are doing something to help with their own care
●Trying to treat or cure their cancer
2200
However, the NCI warns that patients and caregivers should be aware of any potentially negative interactions between cancer treatment drugs and the foods patients eat. For example, St. John’s wort, which is sometimes taken by patients as a complementary treatment for depression,
2201
has been shown to reduce the efficacy of certain cancer drugs such as imatinib
2202
and docetaxel.2203Chronic Kidney Disease
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is the gradual loss of kidney function due to damage, usually from high blood pressure and high blood sugar.
2204,2205 Because kidneys act as filters for 
wastes, kidney damage can result in a buildup of wastes in the body.
2206 The kidneys balance 
out nutrients in the body, such as sodium, phosphorus, potassium, so people suffering from CKD have to closely monitor their intake of these nutrients.
2207,2208 The CDC estimates
that more than 1 in 7 US adults have CKD, however, 90 percent of people living with the disease do not know they have it.
2209 Certain 
diet-related diseases, including diabetes and hypertension, are risk factors for CKD.
2210
Furthermore, high intake of meats and refined carbohydrates increases individuals’ risk of CKD.
2211,2212,2213,2214
For those living with CKD, low-protein, and vegetarian diets have been shown to delay progression of the disease and the onset of renal failure.
2215,2216 Since plant-based foods 
tend to be higher in fiber than meat, higher intake of vegetables and grains can result in more frequent bowel movements and, therefore, less retention of uremic toxins in the blood.
2217 However, patients with advanced 
CKD should attempt to limit their intake of potassium-rich fruits and vegetables, such as bananas and carrots, because potassium has been associated with faster progression of the disease.
2218
The National Institutes of Health National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) recommends a five-step system for CKD patients interested in changing what they eat to manage their condition.
2219 The five steps are:●“Choose and prepare foods with less salt and sodium.” To do this, the NIDDK advises patients to cook from scratch more, and use spices and herbs to flavor food rather than salt.
●“Eat the right amount and the right types of protein.” Protein-rich foods should be eaten in small portions so that the kidneys do not have to filter too much waste produced by the body’s use of protein.
●“Choose foods that are healthy for your heart.” Cooking with olive oil instead of butter, trimming fat and skin from meat, and avoiding deep-fried foods are some ways to ensure food is heart-healthy.
●“Choose foods and drinks with less phosphorus.” Fresh fruits, vegetables, breads, pasta, and rice are examples of foods low in phosphorus. 
●“Choose foods with the right amount of potassium.” People with CKD need to make sure their blood potassium levels do not build up. Apples and peaches are among the fruits low in potassium, and white breads and pastas have less potassium than their whole-wheat counterparts.
2220
Beyond the aforementioned dietary changes that people living with CKD can make, researchers have found that the incorporation of bioactive nutrients, such as microbiota that live in the gut, into the diet can help prevent and treat CKD.
2221 Gut microbes play 182   PART IV  Food as Medicine: Treating and Managing Disease   PART IV  Food as Medicine: Treating and Managing Disease   183
an important role in the body’s metabolism 
and immune responses, and diet directly influences the microbial microbiome of the gut.
2222,2223,2224,2225,2226
Dietary interventions that manage the microbiome can also help control the production and absorption of some uremic toxins, which are toxic compounds which cannot be eliminated from the body and accumulate in the bloodstream.
2227 Research 
into the role of diet in the treatment of CKD has been applied to some existing food as medicine interventions that target patients with the disease.
2228 Many medically-tailored meal 
programs, including Community Servings  in 
Boston,2229Mama’s Kitchen in San Diego2230
and God’s Love We Deliver  in New York 
City,2231 serve nutritious and appropriate food 
to patients with CKD that have been shown to improve health outcomes by slowing disease progression, especially for those patients who are also experiencing food insecurity.
2232 See 
more on medically tailored meals in Part 3 . 
Cirrhosis and Ascites
Cirrhosis of the liver describes scarring of the liver caused by various diseases, including hepatitis and excessive alcohol consumption. Increased scar tissue makes it more difficult for the liver to function properly, which can be life-threatening.
2233 Cirrhosis can cause 
ascites, a condition that occurs when fluid collects in the abdomen, causing extreme pain and difficulty breathing if the fluid moves close to the lungs.
2234
Malnutrition is a common complication associated with cirrhosis.
2235,2236,2237 According 
to a 2019 review  published in Current 
Gastroenterology Reports , “Nutritional status 
is an important predictor of morbidity and mortality in cirrhosis, and it has important implications in selection for liver transplant as poorer nutritional status correlates with higher postoperative complications.”
2238 Nutritional 
intervention is a standard part of the treatment plan for a patient with cirrhosis or ascites.
2239
Early nutrition plans for people with either of these conditions usually include a reduction in sodium intake, however, researchers have found that a reduced-sodium diet alone has minimal results.
2240 Sodium restriction in 
conjunction with protein supplementation might have a stronger effect, but clinical research is still scarce.
2241Researchers have found that nutritional status correlates strongly with a patient’s prognosis when diagnosed with ascites caused by cirrhosis, and nutritional support (such as a medically tailored evening snack) can contribute to improved survival of the disease.
2242 Many researchers agree that 
nutritional intervention should be implemented early in a patient’s treatment.
2243,2244,2245,2246
Furthermore, “dietary management of cirrhosis is not a one-size fits all approach,” wrote reviewers in the Journal of Clinical 
Gastroenterology  in 2018, and should be 
tailored to individual needs.
2247184   PART IV  Food as Medicine: Treating and Managing Disease   PART IV  Food as Medicine: Treating and Managing Disease   185Diabetes
Diabetes is a disease that compromises 
the body’s ability to produce or respond to the hormone insulin, resulting in abnormal metabolism of carbohydrates and elevated levels of glucose in the blood and urine.
2248,2249
Type 1 diabetes (previously called insulin-dependent or juvenile diabetes) refers to a condition where the pancreas either doesn’t produce any insulin or doesn’t produce sufficient insulin and requires daily administration of insulin.
2250 Type 2 diabetes is 
the most common form of diabetes and results from the body’s ineffective use of insulin.
2251
Symptoms of diabetes can include: excessive thirst and/or hunger, frequent urination, unexplained weight loss, fainting, numbness in hands or feet, slow wound healing, and blurred vision.
2252,2253 If left untreated, or 
not treated properly, diabetes can lead to complications including heart attack, stroke, and permanent damage to the kidneys, nerves, and eyes.
2254,2255
Diabetes affects 34.2 million people in the US and 422 million worldwide.
2256,2257 It is 
estimated that 88 million American adults have prediabetes, which is categorized by slightly higher than normal blood sugar levels indicative of increased risk of type 2 diabetes.
2258,2259 There is strong evidence 
that various health and behavioral factors put individuals at increased risk for diabetes and related complications including obesity and overweight, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, physical inactivity and tobacco use.
2260
Among US adults aged 18 years or older diagnosed with diabetes, 89 percent were overweight or had obesity, defined as a body mass index (BMI) of 25 kg/m2 or higher.
2261
As overweight and obesity is the most strongly associated risk factor connected with developing Type 2 diabetes and related complications, there has been great interest in the scientific and lay communities regarding the impact of diet on both preventing and treating diabetes.
2262 Change in diet, along 
with exercise and medication, are standard recommendations as part of treatment plans for individuals with diabetes.
2263
Research on a variety of dietary patterns have shown positive results in the treatment and management of diabetes.
2264,2265 The American 
Diabetes Association (ADA) 2019 guidelines of care state that nutrition and diet should be individually tailored to meet the goals of blood glucose and weight management of a patient.
2266 The ADA states that individualized 
medical nutrition therapy (MNT) is a core component of diabetes management:
For many individuals with diabetes, the 
most challenging part of the treatment plan is determining what to eat and following a meal plan. Each person with diabetes should be actively engaged in developing an individualized eating plan. All individuals with diabetes should be offered a referral for individualized MNT provided by a RD who is knowledgeable and skilled in providing diabetes-specific MNT.
2267
Individual nutrition therapy is recommended 
for all people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes and has shown to be effective for improving glycemic control (target blood glucose levels) and various markers of cardiovascular and hypertension risk.
2268
Overall, research has shown that diets rich in fruits and vegetables, whole grains, nuts and legumes and lower in red and processed meats, refined grains, and sugar-sweetened beverages are consistently associated with a decreased risk of diabetes
2269,2270,2271,2272 as well 
as maintenance of target blood glucose levels for people living with type 2 diabetes.
2273,2274,2275
However, clinical guidelines  suggests that 
there is not an ideal macronutrient profile (carbohydrates, protein, and fat) for all people with diabetes.
2276
There is extensive evidence to suggest that the Mediterranean diet is associated with improved outcomes of glycemic control, body weight, and cardiovascular risk factors in patients with type 2 diabetes.
2277,2278,2279
A meta-analysis  published in the European 
Journal of Clinical Nutrition  in 2015 included 
data from nine randomized controlled trials comparing the effects of the Mediterranean diet with control diets in patients with type 2 diabetes.
2280 The study concluded that 
adherence to a Mediterranean diet seems to have a protective role in glycemic control as reflected by reduced HbA1c (average blood glucose levels over the past three months) and lower fasting levels in addition to decreased insulin resistance and mortality.
2281
186   PART IV  Food as Medicine: Treating and Managing Disease   PART IV  Food as Medicine: Treating and Managing Disease   187A systematic review  of eight meta-analyses 
and five randomized controlled trials 
published in BMJ Open in 2015 compared the 
Mediterranean diet with a control diet in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
2282 The study 
concluded that “The Mediterranean diet was associated with better glycemic control and cardiovascular risk factors than control diets, including a lower fat diet, suggesting that it is suitable for the overall management of type 2 diabetes.”
2283
Research has also demonstrated that a vegetarian diet may also improve glycemic control in patients with diabetes.
2284,2285 A 
2019 systematic review and meta-analysis  of 
nine randomized controlled trials published in Clinical Nutrition  showed that vegetarian 
dietary patterns improved glycemic control and other established cardiometabolic risk factors in individuals with diabetes over a median follow-up of 12 weeks.
2286 While research 
suggests the potential benefits of a vegetarian diet, further information is needed to explore the long term effects of this dietary approach on the management of diabetes.
2287
Fiber is recommended as part of a healthy diet for the management of type 2 diabetes.
2288
Fiber is able to slow down blood sugar spikes after meals
2289,2290 and reduce HbA1c 
and plasma fasting glucose for people with diabetes.
2291,2292,2293,2294 A systematic review 
and meta-analysis  published in PLoS Med
in 2020 examined the effects of a higher fiber intake in adults with prediabetes, type 1 diabetes, and type 2 diabetes and found that   higher-fiber diets resulted in improvements in measures of glycemic control, blood lipids, body weight, and inflammation, as well as a reduction in premature mortality.
2295 The study 
findings concluded with the recommendation that increasing daily fiber intake by 15 g or to 35 g might be a reasonable target that would be expected to reduce risk of premature mortality in adults with diabetes.
2296 This 
recommendation is consistent with 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which recommends that adults eat 22 to 34 grams of fiber each day, the specific amount varying depending on age and sex.
2297
Other diets that have been studied for their effect on diabetes management include low-carbohydrate, low-glycemic index (GI), and high-protein.
2298 In low-carbohydrate diets, 
carbohydrates can be reduced to different levels; according to a 2011 review appearing in Nutrition in Clinical Practice , the typical 
definitions for types of low-carbohydrate diets are: 
1. Reduced-carbohydrate diet: >130 g of carbohydrate per day, up to 45% of total calories
2. LC diet: 30-130 g of carbohydrate per day3. Very low-carbohydrate ketogenic (VLCK) 
diet: <30 g of carbohydrate per day; will usually permit ketosis to occur.
2299
Multiple studies, including randomized controlled trials, have shown that reducing carbohydrate intake might help patients manage their diabetes.
2300,2301,2302,2303,2304 Low-
GI diets include low-glycemic foods (such as oats or muesli), with white bread as the reference point for the highest glycemic food.
2305,2306 These diets might help people with 
diabetes manage their body weight.2307,2308,2309
In addition, high protein diets have been used to manage body weight and glycemic control among diabetic patients.
2310,2311,2312 In 
one 2021 study appearing in the European 
Journal of Nutrition , participants who followed 
a diet with meals provided that consisted of 30 percent of energy from protein (as opposed to the control of 15 percent) saw improvements in body weight, liver fat content, and HbA1c concentrations throughout the 36-week intervention.
2313Research has also explored the potential benefits of components of specific foods in the management of diabetes. For example, researchers have demonstrated that omega-3s from foods such as walnuts may help to reduce overall inflammation and oxidation as well as improving vascular function in patients with diabetes.
2314,2315,2316,2317 Studies 
also suggest that probiotics may have a role in diabetes management by reducing autoimmune responses, decreasing inflammatory reactions and increasing insulin sensitivity.
2318,2319,2320 A systematic review
and meta-analysis published in Nutrition & 
Diabetes  in 2017 stated that olive oil could 
be beneficial in the treatment of diabetes and reported that olive oil supplementation resulted in significantly more pronounced reduction in HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose as compared with the control groups.
2321
Ensuring that dietary interventions for diabetes patients are appropriate for their cultural and religious needs is important for health care providers and dietitians designing these programs to keep in mind.
2322,2323,2324,2325,2326,2327,2328,2329 In a 2020 
article appearing in the journal Health 
Expectations , dietitians reported feeling 
insecure about providing nutritional advice to immigrant patients, citing language barriers and differences in food habits as being major obstacles to providing adequate care.
2330
Obstacles such as these can lead to a lack of adherence to doctor’s recommendations; in a 2019 study appearing in Public Health 
Nutrition  of Mayan communities in Mexico, 
researchers wrote, “Non-adherence [to physician instructions] was influenced by lack of patient–provider shared knowledge and medical recommendations misaligned with local culture.”
2331
“Clinicians must develop self-management guidance within the sociocultural context of the patient if diabetes outcomes are to improve and be sustained,” write researchers 
in the Journal of Clinical Nursing  in 2016.2332
Several dietary patterns have demonstrated benefits for diabetes management, including low-carbohydrate, low-GI, Mediterranean, and high-protein diets,
2333 and should be selected 
based on individuals personal and cultural food preferences and metabolic goals.
2334
However, a better understanding of food habits among cultures around the world is needed in order for physicians, dietitians, and other health care providers to make appropriate and effective recommendations; according to researchers writing in The Lancet in 2014, 
“High quality, large sample size intervention and observational studies and region-specific recommendations are lacking from diverse populations and cultures.”
2335
Food insecure adults are at a higher risk for diabetes and experience increased challenges with diabetes management.
2336,2337,2338 Often, 
the most affordable foods are calorie dense and high in sugar, sodium, and fat, which contribute to disease progression and activ-ity.
2339,2340 Additionally, food insecurity may 
alter food intake or establish binge-fast cycles based on food access and availability.
2341 Pe-
riods of food scarcity may be followed by peri-ods of overconsumption and avoidance of food waste that can lead to hyperglycemia.
2342 Dia-
betes is also associated with a higher per-cap-ita out-of-pocket health care expenditure than any other disease (including heart disease and cancer), which leads patients to purchasing cheap, processed foods high in sugar, sodium, and fat.
2343,2344 Medically tailored meal pro-
grams2345 and food prescription programs2346
are two common Food as Medicine interven-tions that often aim to improve food access in diabetic populations.

Inflammatory Bowel Diseases
More than 1.8 million people in the United 
States have an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which refers to a group of chronic autoimmune inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.
2347 Clinical 
symptoms of IBDs include constipation, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, blood and mucus in the stool, and bowel obstruction.
2348,2349,2350
Ulcerative colitis (UC), a chronic disease in 
which abnormal reactions of the immune system cause inflammation and ulcers on the inner lining of the large intestine, and Crohn’s disease (CD), a chronic disease that causes inflammation and irritation of the digestive tract, are the most common IBDs.
2351 Individuals with IBD go through 
periods of active disease that, if left untreated, can progress to the point of requiring hospitalization and surgery.
2352,2353 Half of CD 
patients require surgical intervention in the ten years following their diagnosis and over a third need more than one procedure.
2354
Long term, persistent inflammatory responses, including IBD, pose significant risk factors for chronic inflammatory conditions, cancer, and infectious disease.
2355
According to the National Institutes of Health National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), the exact cause of IBDs such as UC and CD is still unclear.
2356,2357 However, much research has 
been conducted investigating the potential role individual diet plays in the development of IBDs.
2358,2359 Several studies conducted 
between 2005 and 2011 determined that the omega-6 polyunsaturated fats found in red meat, cooking oils, and margarine increased the risk of developing IBD.
2360,2361,2362,2363
Furthermore, a 26-year longitudinal study of 
more than 100,000 female nurses, appearing in the journal Gut in 2014, concluded that 
“high intake of trans-unsaturated fats may be associated with an increased risk of UC.”
2364Additional research has suggested that IBD may be tied to the ratio of omega-3 versus omega-6 fatty acids an individual consumes rather than overall intake.
2365 A 2019 review
published in International Journal of Molecular 
Science  found omega-3 fats “may regulate 
and attenuate the inflammatory processes and lead to remission of IBD and, thus, could be considered as a new complementary approach to the treatment of these inflammatory conditions.”
2366
Some research has explored potential connections between the consumption of animal products (including dairy and animal proteins) and the development of IBD.
2367,2368,2369, In a 2010 study of more than 
60,000 middle-aged French women, published in The American Journal of Gastroenterology , 
researchers found:
…high protein intake was associated 
with an increased risk of IBD. The positive association between high protein intake and IBD risk was restricted to animal protein intake. Among animal protein sources, both fish and meat were associated with risk, whereas egg and dairy products were not, potentially because of insufficient power.
2370
However, more research is required before 
a connection between protein or dairy intake and the development of IBD can be established.
2371,2372,2373,2374,2375
Consumption of animal products (processed meat and red meat in particular) has also been studied for its potential effect on IBD symptoms.
2376,2377,2378,2379 One 2020 randomized 
controlled trial  appearing in the journal 
Gastroenterology  showed that a diet low in 
red and processed meats did not reduce the rate of CD flare ups.
2380 However, the authors 190   PART IV  Food as Medicine: Treating and Managing Disease   PART IV  Food as Medicine: Treating and Managing Disease   191note that reducing red meat intake might be 
beneficial for other health conditions.2381
To manage the symptoms of IBDs, patients may try a variety of different diets and food treatments, because not all individuals have the same dietary triggers.
2382,2383,2384 Patients 
managing IBDs therefore often follow diet regimens that are highly individualized to their specific needs.
2385 For example, IBD 
patients might try a variety of dietary changes to reduce symptoms, including avoiding high-fiber foods (such as vegetable skins and nuts), eating a high-calorie diet, eliminating lactose from the diet, or reducing salt intake.
2386
Furthermore, according to a 2020 survey
appearing in Frontline Gastroenterology , 
“Dietary advice [from healthcare providers to patients] in IBD is inconsistent reflecting uncertainty among healthcare professionals… With a striking lack of consistent dietary advice, it is not surprising that people with IBD frequently follow their own dietary rules.”
2387 Advice from the National Institute 
of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases is unspecific; patients with CD are suggested to keep a food journal to track their food triggers,
2388 and patients with UC are 
recommended to eat a “healthy diet.”2389
“Guidelines for dietary recommendations and nutritional therapy for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are lacking, and patients are moving toward popular defined diets for relief of symptoms and inflammation,” wrote researchers in 
Gastroenterology & Hepatology  in 2019.
2390
Many of these popular defined diets and food treatments have been studied for their effects on symptoms of IBD, such as a low-FODMAP diet,
2391,2392,2393,2394 an 
anti-inflammatory diet,2395,2396,2397,2398,2399,2400
probiotic supplementation,2401,2402,2403,2404 and 
the Mediterranean diet.2405,2406,2407. Most of 
the research into the efficacy of these dietary interventions, however, remains observational, and additional, randomized controlled studies are recommended.
2408
Dietary Interventions for IBD
Among food-based interventions for IBD, low-FODMAP diets are the most studied, and a plethora of evidence supports their use.
2409 The acronym FODMAP refers to 
fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols,
2410 which 
are short-chain carbohydrates (sugars) that the small intestine absorbs poorly.
2411
Patients on a low-FODMAP diet refrain from consuming foods that contain these types of carbohydrates, including many fruits, vegetables, artificial sweeteners, dairy products, starches, and plant-based proteins, for six to eight weeks.
2412 Much 
published research, including observational studies and literature reviews, points to the efficacy of the low-FODMAP diet as part of a treatment plan for IBD, but researchers agree that more clinical studies, including randomized controlled trials, need to be conducted.
2413,2414,2415,2416
Research has suggested that the Mediterranean diet may be a useful therapeutic tool for IBD due to its potential role in modulating gut inflammation.
2417,2418 A 2020 
study of more than 100 adults with either UC or 
CD appearing in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases
showed “improvement of disease activity and inflammatory markers” after adoption of the Mediterranean diet.
2419 However, according 
to a 2021 study appearing in Nutrition & 
Dietetics, the typical diets of many IBD patients align poorly with Mediterranean diet characteristics, suggesting that “dietary interventions focusing on improving the diet of individuals with inflammatory bowel disease to align with Mediterranean diet characteristics are warranted.”
2420Another diet that is recommended to IBD patients is the Autoimmune Protocol (AIP) diet, which requires the elimination of grains, dairy, refined sugars, legumes, eggs, nuts, seeds, nightshades (e.g., tomatoes, potatoes, and eggplant), and food additives and increases the consumption of fermented foods.
2421 One 
2017 prospective uncontrolled study appearing 
in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases  of 15 adult 
patients found that the AIP diet improved symptoms in patients with UC and CD and 73 percent achieved clinical remission within six weeks of starting the diet.
2422
Another diet that is recommended for patients with IBD is the Specific Carbohydrate Diet (SCD), which removes grains, refined sugars, processed and packaged foods, some legumes and dairy, and starchy vegetables from one’s diet.
2423 A 2016 
comparative analysis  of the SCD published 
in Nutrition  showed improvement in pediatric 
CD patients, as assessed by the Pediatric Crohn’s Disease Activity Index, a validated instrument for measuring disease activity in children and adolescents.
2424 However, 
other retrospective surveys in both children and adults with CD and UC have shown mixed results, with only a subset of patients experiencing small improvements in disease outcomes.
2425,2426,2427,2428,2429
Derived from the SCD is the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Anti-Inflammatory Diet (IBD-AID), which was developed by researchers at the University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School.
2430,2431 According to the developers of 
the diet writing  in Nutrition Journal  in 2014:
The IBD-AID consists of lean meats, 
poultry, fish, omega-3 eggs, particular sources of carbohydrate, select fruits and vegetables, nut and legume flours, limited aged cheeses (made with active cultures and enzymes), fresh cultured yogurt, kefir, miso and other cultured products (rich with certain probiotics), and honey.
2432The IBD-AID has three phases based on the 
level of symptoms a patient is experiencing, each phase building upon the dietary allowances of the previous phase.
2433,2434 In a 
2014 case series report published in Nutrition 
Journal , 100 percent of patients (n=11) placed 
on the IBD-AID reported a decrease in bowel frequency and were able to discontinue at least one of their prior IBD medications.
2435
The authors conclude, “The study of the IBD-AID would benefit from the rigorous analysis provided by a randomized clinical trial, with evaluation of mucosal healing and assessment of change in gut flora to examine the exact mechanism(s) of benefit.”
2436 A 
2021 review  published in Intestinal Research
summarized available data from studies that aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the AID and concluded, “Lack of consistent data to support a practical recommendation of AID in managing IBD patients was noted due to various limitations present in previous research. It is necessary for clinicians advising IBD patients to have in-depth knowledge about the strengths and limitations of the IBD-AID nutritional regime to ensure its effectiveness as a therapeutic strategy.”
2437
Dietary Supplements and IBD
Some IBD patients have turned to dietary supplements as part of their treatment plans, and consume supplements such as curcumin.
2438,2439 Curcumin has been shown 
to inhibit the activation of transcription factors that lead to inflammation.
2440 A subsequent 
double-blind, placebo-controlled trial published 
in Current Pharmaceutical Design  in 2009 
reported that patients given curcumin were less likely than controls to have a recurrence in UC symptoms in the six months after treatment.
2441 Larger studies analyzing higher 
doses of the supplement are recommended to better understand its effect on IBD.
2442
Another supplement that has been studied as a potential diet intervention for IBD is fiber, 192   PART IV  Food as Medicine: Treating and Managing Disease   PART IV  Food as Medicine: Treating and Managing Disease   193derived from a variety of plant sources.2443
A randomized controlled trial  appearing 
in Crohn’s & Colitis in 2020 reported the 
prevention of gastrointestinal symptoms among UC patients treated with 60 grams of oat bran a day,
2444 but additional studies are 
required to determine the long-term benefits of oat bran supplementation.
2445 According 
to a 2017 review  in the journal Nutrients, two 
open-label trials (trials in which information is not withheld from participants) have found that 90 grams of germinated barley foodstuff a day reduced abdominal cramping and prolonged remission in UC patients.
2446 Germinated 
barley appears to be a safe maintenance therapy for adults with UC.
2447
Several clinical trials have investigated the use of various species and strains of E. coli 
and Lactobacillus  bacteria as treatments for IBD.
2448 The results do not appear as 
efficacious for patients with CD as they are for those suffering from UC.
2449 Three meta-
analyses, conducted between 2009 and 2015, reported that some strains, including E. coli 
Nissle 1917 and Lactobacillus GG, were 
just as effective as mesalazine, a common medication for IBD, at preventing a relapse of UC symptoms.
2450,2451,2452 Two additional 
meta-analyses aimed at understanding the impact of probiotics on CD, however, concluded that supplementation with Lactobacillus GG and Lactobacillus johnsonii 
LA1 did not decrease the risk of relapse in CD patients.
2453,2454 Further study of the varying 
impacts of different strains and dosages on both UC and CD are needed to determine the patient populations that could benefit from probiotic treatment.
2455
HIV/AIDS
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the virus that leads to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) by attacking certain infection-fighting cells in the immune system, making it difficult for the body to fight disease.
2456 The primary treatment for 
HIV infection is antiretroviral therapy (ART), medicine that is taken daily to reduce viral load,
2457 but the NIH also recommends good 
nutrition for patients living with HIV to maintain their immune systems.
2458
People with HIV require a diet that promotes energy and is rich in protein and nutrients.
2459,2460 Diet quality has been found to 
be lower in PLWH compared to those without HIV.
2461 Factors that impact the diet quality 
of PLWH include HIV itself,2462 the impacts of 
ART,2463,2464 and the higher risk of PLWH for 
comorbidities such as high triglycerides, high cholesterol,
2465 heart diseases and type 2 
diabetes.2466,2467,2468 In 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) developed nutrition recommendations for PLWH,
2469 followed by a 
2005 review of evidence regarding the role of diet and nutrition in the efficacy of ART.
2470 Key 
recommendations from the report include:
●Adequate nutrition, which is best achieved through consumption of a balanced healthy 
diet, is vital for health and survival for all individuals regardless of HIV status.
2471
●Improved attention to diet and nutrition may enhance ART acceptability, adherence and effectiveness.
2472
The report highlighted that proper nutrition ensures the absorption of medication, reduces side effects, and helps maintain a healthy body weight.
2473,2474
Specific micronutrients that are commonly deficient in PLWH include zinc, selenium, vitamin D, and vitamin A.
2475,2476,2477 Zinc and 
selenium help modulate the immune response of several cell types.2478 Selenium has been 
shown to inhibit HIV replication pathways, and zinc is needed for T cell proliferation, helps with electrolyte absorption, and acts as an anti-inflammatory agent. Early studies in PLWH found a high prevalence of zinc deficiency in HIV patients.
24792480 Selenium 
deficiency is common in PLWH, correlated with CD4 counts (a measure of white blood cells that fight infection), viral load and disease progression.
2481 Foods high in selenium, 
including brazil nuts, tuna, and sardines, 
2482 and foods high in zinc such as seafood, 
namely oysters, and beans are recommended for PLWH.
2483 Additional micronutrients that 
benefit PLWH include vitamin A, which can assist in increasing CD4 count,
2484 and vitamin 
D, which can address HIV-related bone problems associated with nutritional deficiency, HIV-infection, and ART interactions.
2485
Alongside ART, medicinal plant extracts and specific foods have been found to have a beneficial impact on HIV viral loads.
2486,2487
Compounds found in garlic have shown protection against HIV replication, including ajoene, a sulfur-containing compound that has strong anti-HIV activity that blocks viral activity,
2488,2489 and garlicin, reported to inhibit HIV-1 viral replication.2490 However, certain 
forms of garlic can significantly decrease the levels of some antiviral medications.
2491
As a result of increased survival rates for PLWH due to the advancements in treatment and increased accessibility of ART, the population of people aging with HIV is increasing.
2492 Older adults with HIV are at 
even higher risk for age-related complications like bone loss
2493 and cardiovascular disease, 
compounded by their HIV status.2494 With 
heightened risk of decreased muscle mass, memory loss associated with HIV and aging,
2495 PLWH within the aging 
population have an even greater need for adequate nutrition.
2496
Food insecurity adversely impacts the ability to manage HIV.
2497,2498 For people living with 
HIV (PLWH), food insecurity is associated with poor medication adherence, poor immunologic and virologic outcomes, and morbidity.
2499 PLWH are frequently targeted by 
medically tailored meal providers in order to address food insecurity and ensure adequate nutrition.
2500,2501,2502 To learn more about 
medically tailored meals, see Part 3.  
Hypertension (High Blood Pressure)
According to the American Heart Association, “Hypertension is when your blood pressure, the force of your blood pushing against the walls of your blood vessels, is consistently too high.”
2503 Blood pressure is made up 
of two numbers: “Systolic pressure – the upper number in a blood pressure reading – measures how hard the heart pumps blood into arteries. Diastolic – the bottom number – indicates the pressure on the arteries when the heart rests between beats.”
2504 In adults, 
high blood pressure is defined as systolic pressure above 130 with a diastolic pressure of 80 or higher.
2505
One in every three Americans has hypertension, also known as high blood pressure.
2506 Hypertension can lead to 
dangerous complications including heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, congestive heart failure, and aneurysms.
2507,2508 In 2019, 
hypertension was a primary or contributing cause of over 500,000 deaths in the US.
2509 Of 
those in the US with hypertension, only one in four has their condition under control.
2510
Hypertension is also a common underlying 194   PART IV  Food as Medicine: Treating and Managing Disease   PART IV  Food as Medicine: Treating and Managing Disease   195
condition among patients hospitalized for 
COVID-19;2511 according to the CDC, “people 
whose only underlying medical condition is hypertension might be at increased risk  for severe illness from COVID-19.”
2512
Although there are genetic influences on blood pressure, diet also has a significant impact.
2513
A 2018 study appearing in JAMA Cardiology
of the blood pressure levels of indigenous Yanomami and Yekwana individuals in Venezuela demonstrated that increases in blood pressure might not be a natural result of aging, but rather a consequence of other factors such as diet.
2514 In societies where salt 
intake is low, hypertension occurs at much lower rates.
2515,2516 The recommended daily 
intake of salt is less than 2,300mg, or less than a teaspoon, but many  processed foods and fast foods can exceed that amount in just one meal.
2517,2518
Researchers have shown that obesity is a significant risk factor for many health conditions including hypertension.
2519,2520,2521
According to the CDC, “Weight that is higher than what is considered healthy for a given height is described as overweight or obesity. Body Mass Index (BMI) is a screening tool for overweight and obesity.”
2522 BMI is is a 
person’s weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters, and a BMI from 25 to <30 is categorized as overweight and a BMI of 30 or higher is categorized as obese.
2523
Research has demonstrated that obese individuals have a three fold increased liklihood of hypertension.
2524 According to the 
CDC, “Having obesity or being overweight means your heart must work harder to pump blood and oxygen around your body. Over time, this can add stress to your heart and blood vessels.” A 2016 review  highlighted that 
several biological mechanisms underlie the association between obesity and hypertension: “Activation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), the amount of intra-abdominal and intra-vascular fat, sodium retention leading to increase in renal reabsorption, and the renin-angiotensin system, are considered to have important functions in the pathogenesis of obesity-related hypertension.”
2525 While 
obesity is an increased risk factor for hypertension, weight loss of as little as ten pounds has shown to be effective in reducing blood pressure.
2526,2527
The National Institutes of Health National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) recommends the DASH (Dietary Approaches 
to Stop Hypertension) eating plan  for people 
managing hypertension.
2528 This eating plan 
does not consist of specific foods, but rather provides broader nutritional guidelines:
●Consuming vegetables, fruits, and whole grains
●Including fat-free or low-fat dairy products, fish, poultry, beans, nuts, and vegetable oils
●Limiting foods that are high in saturated fat, such as fatty meats, full-fat dairy products, and tropical oils such as coconut, palm kernel, and palm oils
●Limiting sugar-sweetened beverages and sweets
2529
In a 2020 systematic review  appearing in 
Advances in Nutrition , researchers concluded 
that adoption of the DASH diet resulted in significant reduction in blood pressure levels.
2530 The authors also noted that “no 
differential [blood pressure] effect was noticed between hypertensive and nonhypertensive patients,” so people not diagnosed with hypertension can also benefit from the diet’s blood pressure-lowering effects.
2531 According 
to a 2018 review  published in Clinical Nutrition 
ESPEN, the DASH diet may also have beneficial effects on the alterations of blood 196   PART IV  Food as Medicine: Treating and Managing Disease   PART IV  Food as Medicine: Treating and Managing Disease   197pressure, overweight, and obesity among 
adolescents, 2532
Several other dietary changes have been studied for their impact on treating and managing hypertension. A 2018 study appearing in Clinical Cardiology  showed that 
following a plant-based dietary intervention might be an effective approach to treatment for hypertension.
2533 This dietary intervention used 
a food classification system that emphasized raw fruits and vegetables.
2534One 2021 review
from the journal Nutrients assessed the link 
between hypertension and the ketogenic diet, concluding:Available data seem to suggest that 
[ketogenic diets] are able to provide a reduction in blood pressure values but do not induce significantly different changes compared to non-ketogenic diets. These data suggest that the antihypertensive effects of [ketogenic diets] are not directly related to the precise metabolic consequences induced by ketosis but rather indirectly due mainly to weight loss.
2535
Individuals with hypertension are frequently 
targeted by various food prescription programs as a way to increase access to fruits and vegetables.
2536,2537 To learn more about 
produce prescription programs see Part 3. 
Mental Health Conditions and Illnesses
According to the National Institutes of Health National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), mental illnesses can include many different conditions that vary in degree of severity and can be grouped into two broad categories described below:
Any mental illness (AMI) is defined as a 
mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder. AMI can vary in impact, ranging from no impairment to mild, moderate, and even severe impairment. Serious mental illness (SMI) is defined as a mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder resulting in serious functional impairment, which substantially interferes with or limits one or more major life activities.
2538
It is estimated that mental illness affects 52.9 
million people (one in five adults) and serious mental illness affects 14.2 million people (one in 20 adults) in the United States.
2539
Depression and anxiety are the most common mental health conditions, making them a leading cause of disability worldwide.
2540Standard treatment for mental health conditions can include   the use of evidence-
based medications, therapy and psychosocial services; however, it is estimated that in 2020 less than half (46 percent) of those with mental illness received mental health services.
2541
The emerging field of nutritional psychiatry explores the adjunct role of food and nutrition in the prevention and treatment of mental health conditions. In a review  of the nutritional 
psychiatry literature published by Cambridge 
University Press in 2017, the authors advocate for additional strategies to prevent and treat mental health that integrate evidence on the role of food and nutrition: 
Treatment is presently dominated 
by pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants, and psychotherapy, such as cognitive behavioural therapy; however, such treatments avert less than half of the disease burden, suggesting that additional strategies are needed to prevent and treat mental disorders. There are now consistent mechanistic, observational and interventional data to suggest diet quality may be a modifiable risk factor for mental illness
.2542
Epidemiological studies have demonstrated 
a consistent association between nutrition and mental health.
2543 Several systematic 
reviews have shown healthy dietary patterns (characterized by high intake of vegetables, fruit, wholegrains, nuts, seeds and fish, with limited processed food) to be inversely associated with the risk of depression.
2544,2545,2546 Conversely, diets 
consisting of processed, high-fat, high-sugar foods are associated with mental disorders such as depression and anxiety, as well as other neuropsychiatric conditions (conditions that have both neurological and psychiatric features).
2547,2548 Additionally, vitamin 
deficiencies have also been shown to impair mental health and cognition.
2549,2550,2551 The 
link is strongest for vitamin B12 deficiency which has been shown to affect cognition, cause brain shrinkage, and can be associated with depression.
2552,2553,2554,2555 Deficiency in 
omega-3 fatty acids has also been linked to a higher risk of depression and suicide.
2556
Research has also demonstrated that food can affect the chemical composition of the brain and impact mood.
2557 In 1995, Richard 
Wurtman, M.D. and Judith Wurtman, Ph.D., researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), published a review  in 
Obesity Research  outlining how carbohydrate 
foods boosted the production of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that controls mood, sleep, and appetite, and, when elevated, helps you to feel more relaxed and calm.
2558 This research 
has shown that glucose in high carbohydrate food triggers the release of insulin which in turn allows the amino acid tryptophan to reach the brain (by blocking other competing amino acids), stimulating the production of serotonin.
2559 Other research has shown that 
dietary protein raises the level of the amino acids tyrosine and phenylalanine, which produce the neurotransmitters dopamine and norepinephrine, which are brain chemicals that play a role in mood, motivation, and concentration.
2560 Refined sugar intake (e.g. 
sugar-sweetened beverages) has been  linked to increased rates of depression, possibly by altering endorphin levels and oxidative stress.
2561,2562 Vegetable oil, which contains 
many types of dietary fat, has also been shown to activate endorphin neurons in the hypothalamus in rats.
2563,2564
Fruit and vegetable consumption has also been shown to have an impact on mood.
2565,2566,2567 A 2021 study published in 
Clinical Nutrition found that fruit and vegetable 
intake was inversely associated with perceived stress across the adult lifespan.
2568 The study 
indicated that “people who ate at least 470 grams of fruit and vegetables daily had 10 per cent lower stress levels than those who consumed less than 230 grams.”
2569 The 
WHO recommends a minimum daily intake of 400 grams of fruits and vegetables.
2570 A 
2016 study published in the American Journal 
of Public Health  found that increased fruit 
and vegetable consumption was predictive of increased happiness, life satisfaction, and well-being and noted that improvements in happiness were seen long before any physical improvements.
2571 Another study published in
Frontiers of Psychology  in 2018 demonstrated 
that intake of raw fruits and vegetables was associated with better mental health than intake of processed fruits and vegetables.
2572
The gut-brain axis, which refers to the communication between the gut and the brain via neural, endocrine, and immune pathways, has been shown to influence mood and mental health.
2573 The communication works both 
ways, with the brain capable of influencing gut activity and the gut influencing mood, mental health, and cognition.
2574 Evidence 
shows that gut microbiota can profoundly affect the relationship between gut and brain, including influencing mental state and 198   PART IV  Food as Medicine: Treating and Managing Disease   PART IV  Food as Medicine: Treating and Managing Disease   199emotion regulation.2575 Other research shows 
that proper maintenance of gastrointestinal 
homeostasis results in improved cognitive function and motivation.
2576 Evidence also 
shows that several mood disorders, including anxiety and depression, are directly linked to gastrointestinal problems.
2577,2578
Research suggests that regulating gut activity can result in improved mental health.
2579,2580 A 
study published in Scientific Reports  in 2021 
looked at anxiety in women ages 18 to 25 and found that galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) prebiotics (taken as dietary supplements) was associated with a decrease in high trait anxiety and an increase in bacterial abundance.
2581
GOS prebiotic supplements are commercially-available and might be taken to improve anxiety symptoms.
2582 These findings suggest 
that prebiotic supplementation may improve indices of pre-clinical anxiety.
2583
Additionally, mental health disorders have been linked to food insecurity. According to the 2011-2014 National Health Interview Survey, working-age adults (aged 25-61) living with a mental health disability have a 11.3 percent chance of living in a food insecure household.
2584 A 2017 study published in the 
American Journal of Preventive Medicineanalyzed cross sectional data from the 2014 Gallup World Poll, a series of globally implemented, nationally representative surveys, and found that food insecurity was associated with poorer mental health and specific psychosocial stressors across 149 countries.
2585 A study published in Pediatrics
found that household food insecurity was related to 27.9 percent higher rates of depressive symptoms in children.
2586
Researchers recommend holistic approaches to address these interconnected problems and protect children against food insecurity.
2587
Some researchers have questioned where the relationship between food insecurity and mental health originates:
2588 Does food insecurity cause poor mental health, or does poor mental health lead to food insecurity? The two issues have a “bidirectional association whereby food insecurity increases the risk of poor emotional health, and poor emotional health increases the risk of food insecurity,” according to reviewers in a 2017 article appearing in Public Health Nutrition .
2589
Various factors have been theorized to explain this relationship. People suffering from mental health disorders might have higher costs of living, leaving less money to spend on food.
2590 Researchers writing in BMC 
Public Health  in 2021 have also proposed 
that stigmas associated with food assistance might lead to poor mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic:
The stigmatization of receiving food 
assistance might have increased anxiety and depression for those who were not food insecure before, which may help explain why food insecurity is more associated with anxiety and depression than losing a job during the pandemic.
2591
Additionally, people with mental health 
disorders might have a more difficult time “maintain[ing] (or resum[ing]) employment and adequate income supplements for…sufficient financial resources to maintain adequate nutrition,” write researchers in Public Health 
in 2016.
2592
Dietary Interventions
In a review published in Molecular Psychiatry
in 2020, the researchers explored the underlying mechanisms of action by which diet may influence mental and brain health and highlighted the importance of tryptophan available for metabolism in the management of mental health.
2593 The authors also noted the 
need for more research into the associations between dietary tryptophan and mental health: “In the context of using dietary interventions for mental health prevention and treatment, understanding tryptophan availability and metabolism may be important.”
2594
A 2014 systematic review  of randomized 
controlled trials published in Public Health 
Nutrition  reviewed dietary interventions that 
used depression or anxiety as an outcome and sought to identify characteristics of program success.
2595 The review found mixed results 
with 
[A]pproximately half the studies reporting 
improvements in outcomes, with successful trials generally including at least one of the following: single delivery mode (e.g. single or group face-to-face meetings only), employment of a dietitian, explicit recommendation of a diet high in fibre and/or fruit and vegetables. These trials were also less likely to recommend weight loss, reduce red meat intake or follow a low-cholesterol diet.
2596
The ketogenic diet has been proposed as a 
potential therapy for mood disorders such as bipolar,
2597 but more robust trials and research 
is needed to determine the efficacy of the diet in treating mental health disorders.
2598
The SMILES trial, which was published in BMC Medicine  in 2017, was the first 
randomized controlled trial intervention study to test dietary improvement as a treatment approach for depression.
2599 The 
dietary intervention comprised personalized counseling from a clinical dietician in order to support optimal adherence to the recommended Mediterranean diet and was compared to a control group that received social support. Those in the dietary intervention group learned about the Mediterranean diet and were encouraged to consume more whole grains, vegetables, fruit, legumes, low-fat and unsweetened dairy foods, raw and unsalted nuts, fish, lean red meats, chicken, eggs, and olive oil.
2600 They 
were also encouraged to reduce their intake of sweets, refined cereals, fried food, fast food, processed meats, and sugary drinks.The dietary support group had significant improvement in the consumption of the recommended food groups and significantly greater improvements in depressive symptoms compared to the control group.
2601 Study 
results provide preliminary evidence that dietary interventions in clinically diagnosed populations are feasible and may provide clinical benefit.
2602,2603
The burgeoning field of nutritional psychiatry is supported by epidemiological studies that have demonstrated a consistent association between nutrition and mental health
2604
and emerging findings from clinical trials suggest that dietary interventions may play a beneficial role in the treatment of mental health conditions.
2605 Drew Ramsey, M.D, an 
assistant clinical professor of Psychiatry at Columbia University and is one field’s leading proponents of nutritional psychiatry.
2606 Dr. 
Ramsey founded the Brain Food Clinic in New York City, an integrative mental health clinic which incorporates evidence-based nutrition and integrative psychiatry treatments with psychotherapy, coaching, and medication management in the treatment of depression, anxiety and emotional wellness concerns.
2607
In a 2019 New York Times article Dr. Ramsey stated, “We can’t control our genes, who our parents were, or if random acts of trauma or violence happen to us, but we can control how we eat, and that gives people actionable things that they can do to take care of their brain health on a daily basis.”
2608
Most studies to date looking at the relationship between diet and mental illness have been observational and do not provide information about causality or underlying mechanisms.
2609 Additional research is needed 
to elucidate on the underlying mechanisms between nutrition and mental health and explore the effectiveness of various dietary 200   PART IV  Food as Medicine: Treating and Managing Disease   PART IV  Food as Medicine: Treating and Managing Disease   201interventions.2610 However, emerging findings 
from clinical trials suggest that dietary interventions may play a beneficial role in the 
treatment of mental health conditions.2611
Multiple Sclerosis
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease of the 
central nervous system that affects the brain and spinal cord by causing damage to the myelin sheath, the material that surrounds and protects nerve cells.
2612 This damage 
hinders communication between the brain and the body, which causes symptoms of MS, including muscle weakness, memory problems, and more.
2613 Epidemiologic 
research suggests that dietary factors may play a significant role in the development and course of the illness.
2614 And while the cause 
is unknown, there is strong evidence that it is an immune-mediated disease (a dysfunction of the immune system).
2615 There is no 
known cure, but several nutrition and dietary interventions have been shown to alleviate symptoms and slow the progression of the disease.
2616,2617
The nutritional status of MS patients has not been extensively studied, but findings suggest that many MS patients also suffer from various forms of malnutrition, including weight loss, vitamin deficiency, or obesity.
2618
These problems have been associated with impairment of the immune system.
2619
High levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and vitamin D deficiency are both associated with risk of MS.
2620,2621,2622 Studies 
have also shown that a high salt diet might contribute to an increased risk of developing MS.
2623,2624
Various diets have been studied for their efficacy in managing MS symptoms, including the ketogenic diet,
2625 the paleo diet,2626,2627,2628
the Mediterranean diet,2629 low-fat diets,2630,2631
and a very-low-fat plant-based diet.2632 In one 
pilot study of a modified Mediterranean diet appearing in Multiple Sclerosis and Related 
Disorders  in 2019, researchers found that 
the dietary intervention resulted in reduced fatigue, disability, and symptoms among MS patients.
2633 Furthermore, studies have 
shown the efficacy of a modified paleo diet that “consisted of leafy green and sulfur-containing vegetables, intensely colored fruits and vegetables, plant and animal proteins, seaweeds, and nondairy milks” while avoiding gluten-containing grains, eggs, and dairy products.
2634,2635 In a 2017 
randomized controlled trial  published in 
the journal Degenerative Neurological and 
Neuromuscular Disease  measuring the 
effects of this diet on quality of life among MS patients, improvements were seen on many fronts:
Important health-related improvements 
in perceived fatigue, physical and mental health [quality of life], and dominant hand motor function were observed along with increased vitamin K serum levels in the [modified Paleolithic diet] group compared to the control group postprotocol.
2636
One popular diet followed by some people 
managing MS is called the Swank diet, designed and promoted by Roy L. Swank, MD, PhD, a neurologist and longtime researcher of potential treatments for MS.
2637 The Swank diet recommends less 
than 15 grams of saturated fat consumption daily (compared to ~20 grams per day recommended by the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans
2638), five grams 
of cod liver oil, 40-50 grams of vegetable or fish oil, one egg, a multivitamin, whole wheat bread, and fish more than three times per week.2639 A 2019 analysis  of the Swank 
diet in comparison to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans published in Nutrients found 
that the Swank diet meets nearly all of the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) from the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.
2640
Swank diet menus were within the Acceptable Macronutrient Distributions (AMDRs) for protein, fat, and carbohydrates.
2641 The 
diet also recommends patients supplement their diets with vitamin E, fish oil, and a multivitamin.
2642 However, while patients on 
this diet typically meet the recommended levels of vitamins D and E, folate, calcium and iron, supplementation does not correct shortfalls in dietary fiber, potassium or choline.
2643 With specific selection of foods 
to ensure adequate intake of daily fiber, potassium and choline, the Swank diet continues to be one of the most promoted dietary regimens for people with MS, though additional research is needed to assess adherence, nutritional adequacy, and impact of the diet on the disease course of MS.
2644
Another dietary intervention that has been studied inpatients with MS is vitamin D supplementation, which has been shown to have a positive impact on inflammation symptoms in MS patients.2645 Flavonoids 
(organic compounds rich in antioxidants) with phytopigments that are found in fruits and vegetables may be a protective agent to address shifts in the immune system (immunomodulation) and loss of structure in the neurons (neurodegeneration), both of which are characteristics of MS.
2646,2647
Evidence suggests that diets low in fat with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplements can decrease the severity of physical and mental MS symptoms.
2648
According to a 2020 Cochrane systematic 
review  of dietary interventions for the 
treatment of MS, “At present, there is insufficient high certainty evidence as to whether dietary interventions change the course of MS…Future research of dietary interventions in MS should implement higher quality research methodology to limit the potential for bias.”
2649 However, the 
reviewers note that dietary intervention is a common strategy used by patients with MS, writing, “As conventional therapies are only partially effective, people with MS widely use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) with dietary interventions among the most popular form of CAM.”
26502651
Sleep
Research shows that our diets have an impact on our ability to both fall asleep and maintain sleep.
2652,2653,2654,2655 One 2014 study appearing 
in the Journal of Occupational Health  showed 
that a high intake of carbohydrates resulted in poor sleep quality while a high intake of fish and vegetables was linked to improved sleep quality.
2656 Additionally, a 2020 study
appearing in the Journal of the American 
Heart Association  showed that “overall sleep 
quality was associated with consumption of certain nutrients and foods associated with disease risk,” such as added sugar.
2657Another 2013 study appearing in the Journal 
of Epidemiology  showed that a lower-than-
normal protein intake was associated with difficulty falling asleep and poor quality sleep while higher-than-normal protein intake resulted in trouble maintaining sleep.
2658
However, according to a 2016 review
appearing in Advances in Nutrition , “it is 
unknown whether it is sleep that affects dietary intakes or dietary intakes that affect sleep.”
2659 Therefore, some research has 
been conducted to examine the impact of 202   PART IV  Food as Medicine: Treating and Managing Disease   PART IV  Food as Medicine: Treating and Managing Disease   203individuals’ sleep patterns on their ability to 
maintain a diet high in foods perceived as “healthy,” including a 2013 study appearing in 
the International Journal of Obesity .
2660 In this 
study, participants who got only four hours of sleep experienced greater brain rewards (such as pleasure) when looking at unhealthy foods like pizza, doughnuts, and candy compared to when they got nine hours of sleep.
2661 These 
results suggest sleep restriction alters the body’s response to foods.
2662 The researchers 
noted, “Although we believe that all foods have a place as part of a healthy diet, foods established as being unhealthy such as candy and ice cream may produce feelings of guilt regardless of their calorie content.”
2663
One’s ability to get a good night’s sleep is positively correlated with maintaining a healthy diet.
2664,2665According to Dr. Susan Redline , 
a physician as well as a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, “The takeaway is that diet and sleep are entwined. Improving one can help you improve the other and vice versa, creating a positive cycle where they perpetuate one another.”
2666
Some individuals turn to dietary supplements, notably melatonin, as sleep aids.
2667,2668
According to the NCCIH , “Melatonin is a 
hormone that your brain produces in response to darkness. It helps with the timing of your circadian rhythms (24-hour internal clock) and with sleep.”
2669 Multiple Cochrane systematic 
reviews of the impact of melatonin on sleep quality, quantity, and duration have found little to no high-quality evidence supporting its use.
2670,2671,2672,2673 Side effects of melatonin supplementation are poorly understood, so the NCCIH advises that people talk to their health care providers about use of supplements, including melatonin.
2674
Another compound frequently associated with sleep is tryptophan, described  by the National 
Library of Medicine’s PubChem as:
…the least plentiful of all 22 amino acids 
and an essential amino acid in humans (provided by food). Tryptophan is found in most proteins and a precursor of serotonin. Tryptophan is converted to 5-hydroxy-tryptophan (5-HTP), converted in turn to serotonin, a neurotransmitter essential in regulating appetite, sleep, mood, and pain. Tryptophan is a natural sedative and present in dairy products, meats, brown rice, fish, and soybeans.
2675
Some studies have shown that tryptophan 
might be effective as a sleep aid. According to a 2021 article published in Nature and 
Science of Sleep  analyzing survey data from 
7,890 Chinese adults, researchers found that higher intake of dietary tryptophan was positively associated with sleep duration.
2676
A 2022 review  appearing in Nutrition Reviews
showed that tryptophan supplementation might improve sleep quality.
2677 About the potential 
uses for tryptophan, the National Library of Medicine writes, “People use L-tryptophan for severe PMS symptoms, depression, insomnia, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support any of these uses.”

Recommendations 
Incorporating food as medicine practices into traditional healthcare is a strategy that medical 
professionals, insurance companies, policymakers, community organizations, and other key stakeholders must explore to effectively prevent and treat chronic disease, lower health care costs, and improve patient quality of life. Food and dietary modifications can be included as a part of treatment for a variety of diseases and conditions, in conjunction with modern medical treatments. 
This report, with more than 2,500 citations and the curation of more than 650 studies, 
systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and other peer-reviewed journal articles, aims to serve as a bridge between food-based treatment and traditional medicine, demonstrating that both should be considered to most effectively prevent and treat disease. There are still significant opportunities for further research, which have been outlined in this report.
The goal of this report is to bridge the gap between traditional medicine and the use of food as 
medicine in the prevention and treatment of disease. It is our hope that this report will serve as a foundation for understanding the potential uses of food and diet as a therapeutic mechanism. 
The Center for Food as Medicine and the Hunter College NYC Food Policy Center have 
compiled the following recommendations for healthcare professionals, insurance companies, policymakers, community organizations, and other key stakeholders to consider when designing food as medicine interventions, programming, policies, and research. The two Centers make these recommendations to contribute to a healthier and more equitable future for all. 
●Evaluate the impact of food on the prevention and treatment of disease.
οCongress must approve increased funding to the NIH to provide grants to researchers 
specifically focused on the use of food in prevention and treatment of disease, potentially reducing the dependency that many researchers currently have on funding from the food industry. 
οTopic areas for funded research should include:
•Specific dietary patterns and interventions on the prevention and treatment 
of disease.
• Traditional medicine practices from around the world in the prevention and  treatment 
of disease. Practitioners of these traditional medical practices should be involved in the design and implementation of these studies.• Food as medicine programs (such as medically tailored meals and produce 
prescriptions) on health outcomes. 
• Incorporate foods and dietary patterns from many different cultures into this research 
to ensure food interventions are culturally appropriate for all participants.
οResearch should include robust clinical trials with large sample sizes necessary to 
evaluate the efficacy of the above approaches.
οInvest in research to identify and tailor effective implementation of food as medicine programs for at-risk communities in a variety of settings.
●Create and maintain a central repository that identifies all current food as 
medicine programs and interventions operating in the United States.
οThe central repository will identify all existing food as medicine programs in the 
United States (including nutrition incentive and voucher programs, medically-tailored meals programs, produce prescription programs, and culinary medicine and education programs).
οThe repository should be developed to serve as a central access point for food as medicine programs and interventions, where stakeholders can easily engage with existing programs for referrals and obtain up to date information to disseminate to target audiences. 
οThe repository should also provide food as medicine program leaders with opportunities to connect and collaborate (e.g., creation of listservs and forums).  
●Disease-Specific Food as Medicine Research and Resource Guides: Create, 
curate, and update daily disease specific food as medicine research and resource portals / guides to translate and disseminate peer-reviewed, evidence-based research to academics, researchers, physicians, physician extenders , individuals, caregivers, and family members of those diagnosed as well as the general public. These guides will use evidence-based research to dispel myths and pseudoscience and bridge the gap between traditional medicine and the impact of food on disease.
οThe resource guides should be created and updated for specific health states such as 
Multiple Sclerosis, Autism, Diabetes, Crohn’s, Alzheimer’s, and Depression.
οEach resource guide will summarize the disease, how diet can positively or negatively impact it, and specific foods to manage and treat the disease. 
οEach resource guide will be formed with evidence-based research that has undergone critical analysis by health professionals and scientists. The resource guides should be tailored for a variety of audiences and be available at no cost on the internet.
οSee the Center for Food as Medicine’s Food as Medicine Resources and Research Guides as an example.208   Part V Recommendations    Part V Recommendations    209●Develop a robust infrastructure of experts (e.g., Medical Schools, Academic 
Centers, Non-profits dedicated to Food As Medicine, Divisions of the NIH) who can navigate the copious research that has already been conducted in the food as medicine space and translate this research to physicians, health care providers, caregivers, and patients.
οGovernment agencies and academic institutions should fund the creation and 
maintenance of multiple academic centers dedicated to investigating the state of the science, looking through the existing evidence to highlight the highest quality work, and curating current evidence about the relationship between food and disease.
οThese centers will be dedicated to combating misinformation and potentially harmful practices with evidence-based, accurate information about the uses of food in the prevention and treatment of disease. 
οThese centers can provide health care providers, individuals, caregivers, and stakeholders interested in food as medicine with information about the most recent developments in research and the uses of food in the prevention and treatment of disease.
οThese centers can maintain guides   and best practices for organizations and health care settings that operate food as medicine programs (such as medically tailored meals, food prescriptions, and culinary medicine). 
●Mandate education about nutrition and the role of diet in the prevention and 
treatment of disease within educational curricula for physicians and health care providers (e.g., nurses, physician assistants, nurse practitioners).
οRequire a series of nutrition courses among the earliest core requirements in medical 
school curricula that provides all medical students with a background on the role of diet in the prevention and treatment of disease. Courses would include:
• Basic Nutrition
• The Role of Food in the Prevention and Treatment of Disease• Food as Medicine Programming and Interventions (medically tailored meals, culinary 
medicine, food prescriptions)
• Food Insecurity: Causes, Effects, and Solutions• Dietary Supplements, Nutraceuticals, and Functional Foods• The Role of Food in Traditional Medical Practices Around the World• Interacting with Patients about Diet, Lifestyle, and the Impact of Food on Disease
οRequire a series of nutrition courses in health care provider education/training that 
highlights the role diet plays in the prevention and treatment of disease.
οDevelop Continuing Medical Education courses centered on food as medicine topics, including popular food as medicine programs and current evidence about the role of food in the prevention and treatment of specific diseases. 
οDevelop detailed competencies for physicians and health care providers to support Food as Medicine including ongoing training and education on:
•How to apply client/patient‐centered principles to all food as medicine programs 
and interventions.
• Understanding the interaction of food, medicine, disease, and policy. • Understanding the history of food as medicine and respecting the knowledge, 
wisdom, and practices that have been passed down for thousands of years.• Developing effective and ethical communication skills and techniques to achieve 
desired goals and outcomes.
• Applying knowledge of foods, cultural foods, eating patterns, and food trends in 
treatment and counseling of patients.
●Hospitals should be a model for advancing food as medicine and integrating 
dietary evidence for the prevention and treatment of disease into institutional practices and programs.
οHospital administrators and leaders should be provided with up-to-date resource 
guides containing the current state of evidence on the role of food in the prevention and treatment of disease as well as existing policies and programs that can be integrated into hospital systems.
οFederal, state, and local government agencies should provide financial incentives and guidance to public and private hospitals and healthcare settings that develop and maintain food as medicine programs, including medically tailored meals and produce prescriptions. 
οThere must be a complete overhaul of the meals served at hospitals to ensure that hospital food is medically-tailored to address disease and support health, and provides a foundation for the use of food as a therapeutic
•Every meal served at a hospital should be made considering the specific nutritional 
needs of the patient and their specific disease state, based on the latest and most prevailing science.
• Hospitals should provide a variety of different meal options for the diverse cultural 
backgrounds of patients.
• Hospitals should hire chefs to create meals or purchase meals from a vendor that 
are delicious and tailored to the individual nutritional, medical, cultural, and religious needs of patients.
• Hospitals should provide meals that are easy and simply duplicated by their patients 
which would allow them to prepare nutritionally sound meals in their own homes. Patients should be provided with easy-to-follow recipes specifically tied into available foods within that patient’s community.
• Whole-food, plant-forward scratch cooking should be prioritized in all hospital 
kitchens. 
• Ultra-processed foods, unhealthy fats, and high fructose corn syrup must be banned 
completely from hospital cafeterias.
οCreate screening questions for healthcare providers to identify relevant food as medicine 
interventions for patients and require that health care providers integrate nutrition assessment into clinical workflows.
οProvide physicians with robust, evidence-based guides and literature about the state of the science regarding food’s impact on prevention and treatment of disease.
●Enhance and advance public awareness of the role of food in relation to the 
prevention and treatment of disease.
οNutrition and food education must begin early. 
• Public schools should integrate courses into their core programming about basic food, 
nutrition and agriculture.210   Part V Recommendations    Part V Recommendations    211• Publicly funded child care centers should incorporate some form of nutrition and food 
education containing interactive lessons about physical activity and healthy eating.
• Create school gardens in public schools and utilize these gardens as a hands-on 
approach to teaching students about food and nutrition.
οHealthcare settings and community organizations should provide individuals, caregivers, 
and family members of those diagnosed with a disease with evidence-based research about the role that diet and nutrition can play in health and disease. This information should be updated regularly and tailored  to meet health literacy and language needs.. This should be provided in a variety of formats, including on disease-specific microsites, in email newsletters, and in print.
οDe-stigmatize conversation regarding the prevention and treatment of disease with traditional medical practitioners, encouraging health care providers and patients to have open discussions about treatment other than pharmaceuticals. 
οDesign food and nutrition programs for various audiences that take into account factors relevant to particular individuals, groups, and communities.
•Assess the population’s readiness to learn and identify barriers to learning.
• Translate basic to advanced food and nutrition science knowledge into language that 
is understandable and tailored to the audience being addressed.
•Integrate current research and evidence‐informed practice findings into delivery of 
safe and effective nutrition and medical care.
• Increase cultural variety of options available to participants in food as 
medicine programs.
●Increase community access to culturally appropriate, unprocessed, fresh, 
whole foods and food as medicine programs for the prevention and treatment of disease.
οSupport the expansion of sources of fresh fruits and vegetables (such as farmers’
markets, produce carts, supermarkets, food co-ops, community-supported agriculture boxes, and other environments where fresh fruits and vegetables can be purchased) in communities that lack retail access to fruits and vegetables.
• Improve community access to culturally appropriate fresh, whole foods to ensure that 
all people have resources in their neighborhoods to food that they can tailor to their 
cultural, preferential, and medical needs.
οDetermine the most effective communication strategies for the dissemination of 
information about the role of food in the prevention and treatment of disease and existing food as medicine programs and interventions to a wide variety of audiences.  
•Government agencies and offices (such as local representative offices, health 
department offices, and public school administration offices) should distribute information about available food as medicine interventions and programs to constituents.
• Utilize social media, email, physical mail, posters at SNAP and WIC enrollment 
centers, and other forms of media to inform recipients of federal nutrition programs about food as medicine programs and interventions available to them.
οImprove coordination between health insurance companies (including Medicaid and 
Medicare) and healthcare settings in order to identify and connect patients to existing food as medicine programs.οHealth insurance companies must offer coverage for a wide variety of food as medicine programs and individualized nutrition counseling in the treatment of chronic diseases. 
• Increase access to government-funded health care coverage for individualized 
nutrition counseling with Registered Dietitians for preventative screening and care as 
well as for medical nutrition therapy (MNT) specific for a variety of chronic conditions. Currently, MNT is only covered for patients with diagnosed diabetes and kidney disease; Medicare and Medicaid must cover MNT more disease and conditions.
οDevelop and support initiatives that prioritize whole-food, plant-based diets.
οInvite continuous feedback from community members to ensure food as medicine 
interventions are culturally mindful and feasible by participants.
●Congress must increase federal funding for the development of a wide variety 
of food as medicine programs including medically tailored meals, produce prescriptions, and nutrition incentives. There should not be only one food as medicine program option in a given community, due to the variety of logistical, resources, availability and access of potential participants.
●Expand and improve federal, state, and local policies that promote food and diet in the prevention and treatment of disease.
οUpdate the Dietary Guidelines to reflect contemporary evidence about the relationship 
between diet and disease while avoiding influence from large corporations in the food industry.
οRegulate terminology used by companies marketing health and wellness food products and supplements.
•Create specific, FDA-regulated definitions for terms such as “natural,” “functional 
food,” and “nutraceutical.” 
• Develop a federal oversight board that tests nutraceuticals and dietary supplements 
to ensure these products contain exactly the ingredients they claim.
οExpand and improve food assistance programs, including the Supplemental Nutrition 
Assistance Program (SNAP), the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC)
•Increase the minimum benefit amount for all SNAP and WIC recipients, giving them 
more purchasing power.
• Increase the bonus amounts provided by nutrition incentive programs (such as New 
York City’s Health Bucks provided by farmers’ markets) so that participants can purchase more fresh, whole foods.
• Design and promote programs that not only facilitate access to fresh, whole foods, but 
also provide context as to why certain foods impact overall health.
• Expand SNAP pilots that allow recipients to purchase prepared meals with an 
emphasis on nutrition as opposed to cost per meal. 
• Provide equipment to retailers to allow them to accept SNAP, eWIC, and other healthy 
food incentives electronically.
• Facilitate the expansion of food purchases made with SNAP online and wirelessly.212   Part V Recommendations    Part V Recommendations    213

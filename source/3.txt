What is food?
Food is anything liquid, semi-solid or solid which contains nutrients and 
energy and when taken or eaten nourishes the body.
Food contains important substances which provide energy to move, 
think, work, run our body systems, keep us healthy, help to boost our immune system and protect us from infections. When we eat or take food, our bodies absorb useful nutrients into the blood and they are transported to areas where they are needed or stored. The food we eat or take is used for growth, maintenance and body functions.
Classification 	of	foods	according 	to	their	functions
Foods may be classified according to their functions in the body:
a) Energy-giving foods (“GO” foods)
Foods rich in carbohydrates and fats are called energy-giving foods or “GO” foods. They provide energy to the body and are essential for phys-ical activity and basic functioning of the body. Foods like cereals, roots, tubers, starchy fruits and vegetables oils, milk, butter and ghee are good sources of energy.Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers2
 b) Body-building foods (“GROW” foods)
Foods rich in protein are called body-building foods or “GROW” foods. 
These foods help to maintain life and promote growth, repair worn out and damaged body tissues. “GROW” foods come from animal and plant sources. Milk, meat, eggs and fish are good sources of animal proteins while legumes and nuts are good sources of plant protein. Animal protein sources are considered to be of high quality compared to plant sources, apart from soybeans.
Picture 2: Some of the locally available foods that are sources of protein
KEY MESSAGE 
Protein from animal sources is of high quality compared to protein from plant sources, hence there is great need to promote production and consumption of animal products in a community.Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers3
 
Figure 3: Examples of locally available vegetables and fruits which are rich sources 
of vitamins and mineralsc)	Protective 	(“GLOW” 	foods)
Foods rich in minerals and vitamins are known as protective or “GLOW” 
foods. They are essential for promoting body immunity and regulatory functions. Fruits and vegetables are the main sources of “GLOW” foods. Fortified foods, including iodized salt, are also good sources of “GLOW” foods.

Nutrients are substances contained in food that nourish the body. They 
are required by the body to maintain general health and physiological functions, for example: provision of energy, building the body mass, keeping the body warm, boosting immunity and regulating the various 
body functions that help someone to live.
Major	nutrients 	in	human	nutrition
Nutrients in food are divided into three major categories:  
macronutrients, micronutrients and water.
1) Macronutrients
These are required in large amounts:
• Carbohydrates
• Proteins
• Fats/oils
Carbohydrates
These are the primary source of energy in most diets. They include 
starches, fibre and sugars. Sweet foods such as sugar, jam, cakes and 
sugary drinks are sources of carbohydrates but should be consumed minimally because they do not provide any other nutrients and may increase risk of overweight.
Carbohydrate requirements
Individual carbohydrate requirements vary according to age, sex, phys-
ical activity level and physiological status. The recommended daily carbohydrate intake should provide about 45% to 65% of the total body 
energy/calorie requirements of 2000
–3000 kilocalories (kcal). One gram 
of carbohydrates provides 4 kilocalories.
Proteins
Proteins are body-building foods and are required for growth and devel-
opment, maintenance and repair of tissues, production of metabolic and digestive enzymes, and formation of certain hormones and all cells and tissues.Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers6KEY MESSAGE 
Extra protein is required during illness, convalescence and after 
surgery because the body has extra demands for protein to replace and repair worn out tissues.Protein requirements
The recommended intake of protein each day is about 1 gram per kilo -
gram of body weight. Example: if a person is 60 kilograms, he will require 
60 grams of protein each day. This is equivalent to one egg or a piece of 
meat about the size of an egg. However, children, teenagers, and preg -
nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below:
• Children: 30 –50 g (half a palm of meat)
• Teenagers: 60 –75 g (a palm of meat)
• Adults: 60 –70 g (a palm of meat)
• Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat)
Fats and oils
Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant 
sources.
Fats are rich in energy, build body cells, support brain development of 
infants, help body processes, and facilitate the absorption and use of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The major component of lipids is glyc-erol and fatty acids. According to chemical properties, fatty acids can be divided into saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Generally lipids containing saturated fatty acids are solid at room temperature and include animal fats (butter, lard, tallow, ghee) and tropical oils (palm, coconut, palm kernel). Saturated fats increase the risk of heart disease.
Those containing unsaturated fatty acids are liquid at room temperature. 
These include monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and are found in vegetable oils such as sunflower, corn, soybean, canola and olive oils. Replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats lowers risk of heart disease.Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers7Fat/lipid/oil requirements
Fat provides high amounts of energy to the body; 1 g of fat produces over 
9 kcals.
Daily intake of fats/oils should not exceed 30% of total kilocalories. Intake 
of saturated fats should be 10% or less of the total fat intake per day. Cholesterol intake should not exceed 300 mg.
Sources of fats/lipids/oils
• Animal sources include meat, suet, bacon, oil fish, cheese, butter, 
lard, milk, and egg yolk. 
• Plant sources include groundnuts, soya, cocoa, sim-sim, maize, avo-cado, margarine, wheat germ, corn, sunflower, and palm oil.
KEY MESSAGES 
• Excessive consumption of fat increases risk of heart disease. Use of oils from plant sources and fish reduces risk of heart 
disease.
• Fat should be consumed in small quantities by adolescents and 
adults. Saturated fat increases the risk of heart disease. Re -
placing saturated fat with unsaturated fat lowers risk of heart disease.
Dietary fibre
This is a form of complex carbohydrate that is part of the nondigestible 
portion of the food.
Dietary fibre increases the body’s sense of satisfaction thus preventing 
overeating. Diets high in fibre protect against constipation. Fibre can slow the body’s absorption of sugar and cholesterol protecting the body from diseases of the heart and diabetes. Dietary fibre adds bulk to the faeces. In addition, dietary fibre slows down the breakdown of starch.
Main sources of dietary fibre
• Whole grains of cereals, for example: oats, millet, and maize bran.
• Vegetables, for example: dodo, nakati, malakwang, cabbage, and 
pumpkin leaves.Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers8KEY MESSAGE 
Promote production and consumption of fruits in all households as 
part of the broad iron deficiency anaemia prevention strategy.• Legumes such as beans, peas, and pigeon peas, among others.
• Fruits such as mangoes, oranges, and pineapples, among others.
2) Micronutrients
These are required by the body in small amounts and include: vitamins and minerals.
Vitamins
Vitamins are organic compounds that perform specific metabolic func -
tions in the body. There are two forms of vitamins:
a) Fat-soluble vitamins
These are stored by the body and require dietary fat to be absorbed.
They include vitamins A, D, E and K. Fat-soluble vitamins are necessary 
for development and maintenance of body tissues and their functions, for example: eyes (vitamin A), bones (vitamin D), muscles and blood clot -
ting (vitamin K), protection of cells (vitamin E), synthesis of enzymes and 
absorption of essential nutrients. Dietary sources of fat-soluble vitamins 
include carrots, tomatoes, liver, offal, kidney, gizzard, heart, milk and milk products and leafy vegetables.
b) Water-soluble vitamins
These are not stored by the body and must be consumed regularly.
They include vitamins C (ascorbic acid) and the B complex group. Their 
functions include releasing energy, supporting utilization of macronu -
trients and synthesizing red blood cells. Dietary sources of water-sol -
uble vitamins include fruits, dark leafy vegetables, whole grains, 
meat, fish, poultry and fortified cereals. Citrus fruits are an espe-
cially good source of vitamin C. Vitamin C is crucial for improving iron  
bioavailability from plant food sources.Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers9Vitamins requirements
• Water-soluble vitamins are not stored in the body and must be con -
sumed daily.
• Fat-soluble vitamins are stored in the liver and may not have to be 
taken daily, excessive intake of these vitamins is toxic (refer to Annex 1 
for RDAs).

Minerals are required for the normal functioning of body processes, 
including growth, development, water balance and neurological processes.
Minerals of public health importance
Iron is an essential component of blood and helps transfer oxygen to 
various body tissues. Dietary sources include red meat, fish, poultry 
(easily absorbed), legumes, leafy green vegetables (less easily absorbed, but absorption increases if eaten with animal source iron or vitamin C).
Calcium is a key component of bones and teeth and is needed for a strong 
skeleton and important in blood clotting. The major source of calcium in 
the world is milk and milk products. Other sources include fish eaten with bones (silver fish—mukene, haplochromis species—nkeje) and dark green vegetables (plant sources are not well absorbed).
Iodine is important for thyroid function and for mental development of 
children. The most important dietary source is iodized salt.
Zinc enhances and strengthens the immune system, helps wound 
healing, facilitates digestion and is an important component of skeletal 
muscle. Dietary sources include beef, seafood, liver, nuts, beans and whole grains.
Other minerals involved in various body functions are chromium, 
copper, fluoride, magnesium, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, potas-
sium, phosphorus, sodium and selenium.
Mineral requirements
Minerals that are required by the body in relatively large amounts such 
as calcium, iron, phosphorus, potassium, sulphur, chlorine, sodium and magnesium require deliberate efforts to be supplied them through increased food production, consumption and supplementation.
Most trace mineral elements such as iodine copper, manganese, fluo -
rine, cobalt, nickel, zinc, chromium and selenium are supplied by a wide 
variety of foods and the body is unlikely to be deficient in them when one consumes a balanced diet.Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers13SUMMARY
• Promote the consumption of both animal and plant foods in 
the community since minerals from plant sources are poorly 
absorbed.
• Use iodized salt for cooking.
• Consumption of animal source foods is necessary for a family 
to achieve a balanced diet.
• Animal source foods are a good source of readily digested protein and are rich in energy. Animal source foods are easily absorbable and an efficient source of micronutrients (calcium 
and B12 from milk, and iron, zinc and vitamin A).
• Animal source foods are exclusive sources of dietary vitamin 
B12, and a good source of preformed vitamin A, particularly in 
milk which protects children from diseases.

Maintains the fluid balance, cell turgidity, media for all biochemical 
reactions in the body, solvent for certain nutrients, used in removing excreta and keeps some parts of the body moist. Water is essential for life because it forms part of the body cells and fluids, such as blood and 
digestive juices.
Water requirements
Drink water everyday especially in hot weather when much is lost 
through sweating to avoid dehydration. A minimum of 2 –3 Litres per day 
is recommended for an adult person. All drinks such as tea, coffee, fruit 
juice count towards there commended daily total of at least 8 cups a day (for an adult). Children should drink all the time as they need.
The body requires water for many functions:
• To transport nutrients around the body.
• To make blood, saliva, tears and sweat.
• To enable body processes such as digestion.
• To keep the mouth and lungs moist, and to keep the skin moist and 
cool.
• To produce breast milk, which is also a source of water.
Extra water is needed:
• During illness when a raised temperature results in increased sweat -
ing. If vomiting or diarrhoea has occurred, both of which can cause 
dehydration especially in babies.
• In lactation when extra water is required for milk production. After 
intensive activity such as sport.
NUTRITION
Nutrition is the process of providing or obtaining the food necessary 
for health and growth. It broadly encompasses all actions necessary for obtaining, handling, preparing, serving, eating and utilization of food by 
the body. When individuals or communities do not feed appropriately 
they face a possibility of becoming malnourished and can face serious Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers16health problems. Extension workers should promote good nutrition in 
the community.
What	is	nutrition?
Good nutrition refers to a state when the food we eat is able to provide the recommended amounts of nutrients for the body to perform all its physiological activities. It is dependent on one’s age, physiological status, 
physical activity level and sex. Good nutrition is important throughout 
the life cycle; right from pre-conception, conception, pregnancy, infancy, 
childhood, adolescence and adulthood. Good nutrition makes an indi -
vidual healthy, more productive and improves the quality of life.
Good nutrition means:
• Eating the right food.
• At the right time.
• The right amounts (quality and quantity) to ensure a balance diet 
and should be prepared in the correct way and right place.
Good nutrition is important because it:
• Enhances physical and cognitive development.
• Enhances breast milk production for the mother to adequately breastfeed her child.
• Builds and or boosts body immunity reducing susceptibility to dis -
ease.
• Reduces costs involved in disease management and control
• Enhances productivity.
A person with poor nutrition is at high risk of:
• Poor growth and development of the body and the brain (especially in young)
• Frequent illness, infections and prolonged (delayed) recovery
• Reduced ability learn or perform in school
• Reduced ability to work and earn a living
• DeathFood and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers17CHAPTER TWO
MALNUTRITION AND ITS PREVENTION
This chapter defines malnutrition, its prevalence, consequences and 
possible agriculture based strategies to prevent or alleviate malnu -
trition.
A malnourished and sickly population has low agriculture productivity.
The extension worker should demonstrate to community and households 
the gravity of the malnutrition situation and thus the need to prevent it.
What	is	malnutrition?
Malnutrition is a condition that develops when the body does not get the right amount of the nutrients it needs to maintain healthy tissues and organ function. It includes conditions, such as undernutrition, overnu-trition and micronutrient deficiency diseases (like vitamin A deficiency, iron deficiency anaemia, iodine deficiency disorders and zinc deficiency).
Malnutrition affects MOSTLY people of the following categories:
• Infants and children from pregnancy to two (2) years of age
• Non-breastfed children
• Pregnant and lactating women
• People suffering from chronic or infectious disease
• People are food insecure
Types	of	malnutrition
a)	Undernutrition
This is a nutrition a deficiency resulting from inadequate intake of food 
or inability of the body to convert or absorb food.
Undernutrition is the most common and easily observable type of 
malnutrition. Undernutrition often presents itself in two forms: acute and chronic. 
Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers
181) Acute malnutrition: Underweight/wasting
Acute malnutrition takes place within a short time and can present loss 
of muscles in bulk. When severe, presents with visible wasting (promi -
nence of bones) and/or symmetrical swelling of the body starting from 
both feet.
2) Chronic malnutrition: Stunting
A child’s height is one of the most important indicator of his/her well-
being. Height reflects the accumulated total of early-life health and 
diseases. The problems that prevent children from growing tall also 
prevent them from growing into healthy, productive, smart adults. Height 
predicts adult economic outcomes. Chronic undernutrition that affects 
children right from pregnancy to 5 years of age affects their growth and leads to reduced growth in stature (short-for-age). Chronic malnutrition is due to prolonged long term deprivation of proper nutrients/foods to 
children.

Assessment, Counselling and Support into Health Service Delivery 2015)Severe malnutrition   Chr onic malnutrition (Stunting)Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers19b)	Micronutrient 	malnutrition 	(lack	of	minerals	and	vitamins)
This type of malnutrition is called “hidden hunger;” and is due to inad -
equate intake of dietary mineral salts and vitamins leading to vitamin 
mineral deficiencies (VMDs). This form of malnutrition cannot be identi-
fied easily except in advanced stages when clinical signs appear.
Minerals and vitamins are required by the body in very small quantities, 
they are very important in protecting the body against infections. Usually, 
their absence in the diet does not cause a person to “feel hungry.”
Micronutrient deficiency disorders of public health significance in 
Uganda are:
• Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA)
• Vitamin A deficiency (VAD)
• Iodine deficiency disorder (IDD)
• Zinc deficiency disorder (ZDD)
c)	Overnutrition
This is the excessive intake of nutrients in foods over a given period of 
time exposing individuals to poor health. Overnutrition results in over -
weight, obesity, or vitamin toxicity. Overnutrition may be caused by any 
of the following factors:
• Eating habits (overeating)
• Health conditions
• Taking too many unprescribed dietary supplements
• Lack of physical activity (sedentary lifestyle)
• Psychological factors (stress)
• Environmental factors (unsafe foods, e.g., heavy metals in food, 
peer pressure)
• Medication
• Genetic factorsFood and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers20Prevalence 	of	malnutrition 	in	Uganda
Malnutrition is one of the main public health and economic and devel -
opment problems facing Uganda. Children below the age of five years 
and women in reproductive age including pregnant women and lactating 
mothers are mostly affected (UDHS 2011). Children below the age of 5 years suffer mostly from under nutrition with:
• 33% of these children suffer from chronic undernutrition (they are 
stunted)
• 14% are underweight (body weight too light for their age)
• 49% suffer from iron deficiency anaemia (lack of iron/blood)
• 60% suffer from different forms of iodine deficiency disorders (IDD) 
Likewise women in reproductive age (15 –49 years) also suffer from 
malnutrition:
• 52% of pregnant women and lactating mothers have vitamin A defi-
ciency
• 23% suffered from iron deficiency anaemia
 
Figure	1.	Summary 	of	types	and	categories 	of	malnutritionFood and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers21Causes	of	malnutrition?
There are several interconnected causes of malnutrition, ranging from 
policy issues to underlying community and cultural situations to house hold conditions and are commonly categorized into immediate causes, 
underlying cause and basic causes.
Immediate causes include:
• Inadequate dietary intake including poor quality and quantity of 
food in the diet (poor dietary diversity).
• Infection and diseases such as malaria, diarrhoeal diseases, acute respiratory infections, measles and worm infestations.
• Low intake of foods rich in appropriate nutrients.
• Low intake of substances like vitamin C that enhance nutrient ab-sorption.
• High intake of factors like phytates and tannins that inhibit nutrient absorption.
• Food insecurity.
Underlying causes include:
• Household food insecurity including poor access to a diverse diet, inadequate quantity of food available and accessible, and seasonal 
fluctuations in food availability.
• Inadequate maternal and childcare, including suboptimal maternal 
nutrition and infant feeding practices, often a result of heavy work -
loads for women and frequent births.
• Poor access to healthcare and inadequate water and sanitation, leading to increased illness.
• Inadequate and/or incorrect feeding practices.
• Inadequate caring capacity for example inadequate time, inade -
quate knowledge.
• Low levels of family education, awareness, knowledge and motiva-tion.
• Intrahousehold maldistribution of access to food, health services and care.Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers22• Poor food preparation, storage, preservation and processing practices 
at household levels.
• Beliefs and practices that restrict access to certain foods for some family members (food taboos).
• Poor health services and/or agricultural infrastructure.
• Lack of institutional capacity in nutrition and/or personnel trained in the various components of community nutrition programs.
• Low production of diversified nutritious foods.
• Lack of household level gardening.
• Insufficient marketing infrastructure for key food.
• Poorly developed commercial food processing industry.
Basic causes include:
• Limited livelihood opportunities and unequal economic structure.
• Inadequate educational opportunities.
• Priorities guiding the allocation of public funding and other resources.
• Quality of social and political leadership, e.g., poor economic or physi -
cal access to markets.
• Little or no productive land.
• High prevalence of certain endemic diseases, e.g., tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS.
• Low status of and lack of resource control by women.
• Failure to consider nutrition needs in agriculture and health poli -
cy-making.
• Lack of resources to produce nutrient-rich foods.
• Poor economic or physical access to markets.
• Little or no productive land.
• Lack of access to safe water for drinking, hygiene and/or irrigation.
• Seasonality of food availability.
• Low status of and lack of resource control by women. Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers23

(Source: Adopted from the UNICEF conceptual framework 1990)Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers24Consequences 	(cost)	of	malnutrition
a)	Consequences 	of	undernutrition
Child deaths, diseases and disability
• Newborns who are born small (low birth weight, that is less than 2.5 
kg) for their gestational age are more likely to die than children born 
with a healthy weight.
• A severely stunted child is four times more likely to die than a 
healthy child (Lancet 2008).
• A severely wasted child is nine times more likely to die than a healthy child (Lancet 2008).
• Micronutrient deficiencies—including vitamin A, zinc and iron—im -
pair the immune system, increasing risk of illness and death.
• Anaemia increases risk of maternal and perinatal deaths (death of infant in the womb and during the first 6 weeks of birth).
• Vitamin A deficiency causes blindness.
• Malnutrition has negative consequence on physical productivity, health and education outcomes with consequential negative im-
pacts on socioeconomic development in Uganda.
Malnutrition weakens brain development and nervous system
• Impaired brain development, poor school achievement, absentee -
ism (stunting, iron deficiency, anaemia, iodine deficiency)
• Neural tube defects: undeveloped back bone and the nervous sys-
tem (folic acid deficiency)
• Impaired foetal brain development, brain damage, severe mental retardation, or congenital abnormalities (iodine deficiency in preg -
nancy)
• Diminished income: earning capacity in adulthood
Malnutrition decreases productivity and economic growth
• When malnourished individuals are sick, they are weak and cannot perform their daily work for example sick farmers.
• Individuals with iron deficiency anaemia (particularly women) be-come tired easily and cannot work for longer hours.Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers25• Shortage of iodine decreases IQ and causes a productivity loss.
• Farmers with low literacy levels are less likely to adopt improved 
agricultural practices hence leading to poor agricultural production 
and productivity.
• People with low literacy levels are bound to have poor health seek -
ing behaviours and access to quality health services.
• Mothers with low education level are likely to follow poor feeding 
practices hence affecting the nutritional and health status of family 
members.
• Contributes to poverty.
• Cost of treating illnesses attributable to malnutrition.
• Cost of caring for sick.
• Lost care for other (not sick) household members.
b)	Consequences 	of	overnutrition
Malnutrition can lead to multiple medical conditions including:
• Coronary heart disease (heart attack) 
• Diabetes (high blood sugar)
• Gout (swollen painful joints)
• Hypertension (high blood pressure) 
• Overweight
• Obesity 
• Death
Malnutrition increases the risk of death and illnesses
Malnutrition weakens immunity and predisposes individuals to different 
infections.
• More than half of infant deaths are associated with malnutrition.
• Marasmus and kwashiorkor and finally death are caused by severe 
malnutrition.
• Goitre due to iodine deficiency.
• Night blindness to complete blindness from vitamin A deficiency.
• Anaemia from iron deficiency.Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers26Agriculture-based 	interventions 	and/or	strategies 	aimed	at	
preventing 	malnutrition
• Promoting production of nutrient-rich foods and rearing of live -
stock.
• Promoting backyard farming, kitchen gardening, and hanging gar -
dens.
• Encouraging rearing of small livestock and consumption of their 
products.
• Promoting production and consumption of biofortified foods.
• Promoting consumption of nutritious meals and diet diversification.
• Encouraging proper food preparation and feeding practices.
• Supporting and promoting nutrition education and good child caring practices.
• Supporting and promoting labour-saving technologies to reduce women’s workload, e.g., establishment of woodlots, water harvest -
ing technologies and various energy saving technologies.
• Promoting household and community-level food processing tech-
nologies.
• Promoting good post-harvest handling practices and food safety 
along the value chain.
• Promoting water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) practices.
• Promoting community-based food and nutrition information sys-tem to track vulnerable households and communities for corrective 
action.
• Integrating appropriate essential nutrition actions in the agricultural 
extension system.
• Mainstreaming gender considerations in agriculture development programs.Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers27SUMMARY
• Malnutrition can be undernutrition or overnutrition.
• Undernutrition includes acute malnutrition, chronic malnutri -
tion and micronutrient deficiencies.
• Undernutrition has immediate causes (inadequate food intake 
and illness), underlying causes (household food insecurity, 
inadequate maternal and child care practices, poor access to 
health, water and sanitation services) and basic causes (sub -
optimal political, economic, and social policies and systems).
• Consequences of malnutrition include increased illness and death, poor growth and development, lower labour produc -
tivity, poorer educational attainment, and noncommunicable disease like diabetes and hypertension.
• Undernutrition occurs across the life cycle and can pass from one generation to another.
• It is important to break this cycle through interventions to promote nutritional status of adolescent girls and women of 
reproductive age and from pregnancy through 24 months of 
age.Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers28CHAPTER THREE
MEAL PLANNING
Meal planning is a process of determining, selecting and preparing 
foods to ensure a balanced diet for target groups or individ -
uals. People will always want to eat food that is acceptable, therefore knowing the consumers’ characteristics, food preferences and location is important in proper meal planning.
Common terms used in meal planning
A meal is a selection of foods prepared and served in a single serving. 
The number of meals an individual eats in a day depends upon age, physiological status, health status, and physical activity level. Children eat small portions because their stomachs are small. However, they have increased nutrient requirements for growth and development and thus require more frequent feeding compared to adults.
A balanced diet is a feeding pattern that provides adequate amounts 
of nutrients in their correct proportions as required by the body at a particular time. In order to obtain an adequate supply of nutrients human beings need at least three balanced meals a day in case of adults and at least five meals a day for children. Attaining a balanced diet requires that one: eats various food stuffs in a day, makes careful food choices from different food groups, and eats food in the right proportions and quality as required by the body.
Variety means including different foods from different food groups and 
within each food group, for example consuming cereals, root tubers (sweet potatoes, cassava), meat, vegetables and variety of fruits.
A serving is a quantity of food suitable for or given to one person in 
one meal.
Moderation  means keeping servings reasonable. This involves self-
control and addresses the aspect of too much food intake that leads to 
becoming overweight and obese.Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers29A food pyramid is a guide showing how different categories of foods 
should be utilized to achieve proper health. The foods at the base of the pyramid can be eaten more and those at the tip of the pyramid eaten in small amounts or sparingly. All of these types of foods shown in the 
pyramid should be eaten but foods at the bottom should be eaten most 
and those at the top more sparingly.

Points to consider while planning a meal
• Family incomes and lifestyles
• Individual habits and preferences
• Nutritional/health status of target consumers
• Daily routines of family members such as work and schoolFood and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers30• Availability of storage and cooking facilities
• The occasion for which meals are required
• Food availability and season
• Nutritional needs of targeted consumers
• Time available for cooking
• Balance and variety in making food choices
• Type of fuel available for food preparation
• Meals are attractive and enjoyable
• Meals satisfy the appetite
• Meals are available when needed
Cost	reduction 	in	meal	planning
Important issues to be considered:
• Knowledge about nutrient content of foods, food groups and food 
guides. Foods are selected from each of the groups according to the 
required servings.
• Plan several meals in advance.
• Consider foods available according to season.
• Take off time to look for affordable places to buy food to reduce on 
expenditure.
• If possible purchase in bulk as it reduces expenditure.
• Avoid foods which are poor value for money such as food containing only energy, e.g., sodas and many artificial soft drinks.
• Except for special occasions, plan several meals at least a week before.
• Within a week or the day take advantage of opportunities when food supply is plentiful and cheap. For instance on market days or 
times of the day when farmers are selling directly to urban consum -
ers.
Selection 	of	foods	to	achieve	a	balanced 	diet
Energy giving foods the “GO” foods (carbohydrates)
As much as possible eat more of cereals (millet, maize and sorghum) 
compared to tubers (cassava, sweet potato and banana). At least take Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers31cereals in porridge form if you can’t manage them in the bread form 
every day.
Body building foods “GROW” (proteins)
The best sources among these foods are animal foods i.e., milks, meats, 
fish, eggs, poultry. However, for those with a lot of money it is important 
to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with 
four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also 
be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes.
Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to 
some extent rabbits.
Many people cannot afford animal protein. In that case they can use 
much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, 
common beans and ground nuts. Soy bean protein is exceptional in the 
plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body.
Feed on some little animal protein in particular milk which is also rich in 
protective nutrients, if you are getting most of your protein supply from 
plants. This lowers the cost of feeding but maintains the quality.
Milk is both a protective food and a body building food. Thus, as much as 
possible, it must be put in place for families to access it.
Protective foods “GLOW” (vitamins and minerals)
Select dark green leafy vegetables (DGLV), e.g., dodo, malakwang, (at 
least one serving per day) and yellow fruits (ripe bananas [2 small ripe 
apple/sweet bananas or 1 bogoya per day], one orange or one mango). 
Citrus fruits are very good but we don’t have much in some parts of Uganda. The guavas can however substitute the citrus fruits well. Two guavas per day can be very healthy.Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers32
 
Picture 6: Examples of a variety of the locally available foods from the three main 
food groupsAn example of a mixed meal guide to achieve a balanced diet
SUMMARY
• Eat a lot of whole cereals and beans or legumes generally, if 
you can’t afford animal protein and as much as possible take 
some milk in your meals.
• Eat a variety of food types from different main three groups 
(energy giving, body building and protective foods) at a very 
meal.
• For lunch and supper take a fruit and a serving of vegetables 
(100g or one handful of fresh vegetables).
• Avoid eating too much salt, too much sugar, drinking too much alcohol and too much fatty red meat.
• These feeding habits predispose people to diseases such as: high blood pressure, diabetes, overweight, obesity.Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers33CHAPTER FOUR
ESSENTIAL NUTRITION ACTIONS IN 
AGRICULTURE
The Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries shares a 
role in executing essential nutrition actions. Those areas where the 
ministry of agriculture can contribute towards nutrition improvement are:
• Promoting control of anaemia.
• Promoting production and consumption of iron-rich foods.
• Promoting production and consumption of vitamin A-rich foods.
• Promoting consumption of iodized salt.
• Promoting vitamin A supplementation.
• Ensuring adequate intake of quality food for the household mem -
bers.
• Reduction of women workload in agriculture.
Therefore, consistent with these actions, the Ministry is concerned with nutrition for pregnant mothers, breastfeeding mothers and children below five years.
Nutrition 	for	pregnant 	women
It is necessary that a woman is well nourished before pregnancy so that by the time she conceives, the body has sufficient capacity to meet both her and the baby’s needs. A malnourished woman may fail to deliver baby alive or if she does, the baby is likely to be underweight (the normal range is 2.5–4.5 kg at birth). One of the leading causes of maternal death at childbirth is insufficient blood.
During pregnancy women have high nutrient needs because they have 
to build foetus tissue, build reserves for breast milk and also cater for 
their own nutritional needs. On average women should gain 8
–12 kg in 
the course of pregnancy. Pregnant women need to eat more food rather 
than decrease the intake.
• Pregnant women need to consume balanced diet following the Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers34guidelines for selecting energy-giving foods, body-building foods 
and protective foods. Pregnant women especially need foods rich in 
iron and vitamin A in addition to the balanced diet. Iron needs are 
highly increased partly due to the need to build reserves for child 
up to six months after birth before initiating complementary food 
intake.
• Pregnant women need to take foods rich in calcium, e.g., milk and mukene (silver fish) partly to take care of the increased requirement 
for building the foetus skeletal structure.
• Pregnant women have higher needs for nutrients generally and 
should take snacks in between meals.
In addition, pregnant women should be educated to strictly observe the 
following:
1. Take the required amounts of iron and folic acid supplements to 
prevent anaemia.
2. Sleep under an insecticide-treated mosquito net.
3. Visit the nearest health facility at least four (4) times for antenatal 
care. This will enable them access a number of services that prepare 
them to deliver a healthy baby.
4. Deliver in a healthy facility with the help of a skilled health worker.
5. Get deworming pills, IPT and tetanus vaccine from a health facility.6. Avoid excessive workloads therefore community and family support 
mechanisms should be encouraged.
7. Pregnant women should limit intake of alcohol, cigarettes. These 
cause negative effects on the foetus.
8. Should strictly take drugs on advice of the health personnel as some 
of them are potentially harmful to the unborn child.
9. Avoid negative cultural practices that reduce the intake of nutritious 
foods or impact negatively on their health such as:
• Not consuming chicken and eggs.
• Pregnant women not defecating in toilets/pit latrines.Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers35Nutrition 	for	breastfeeding 	mothers
Nutritional requirements during breastfeeding are higher than during 
pregnancy because the mother has to produce enough milk to sustain a baby (bigger than the foetus) for the first six months and beyond. Breast -
feeding women need to eat a wide variety of foods.
Nutrition guidelines for pregnant women as well apply here but a 
lactating mother needs to eat much more; that is to say one extra meal (five meals in total).
Breastfeeding mothers should also take a lot of fluids to cater for the 
high amounts of water used to make breast milk. They should avoid self-medication, smoking and alcohol to prevent intoxicating the baby.
Breastfeeding mothers should avoid stress and have enough rest.KEY MESSAGES 
• Ensure that a pregnant mother has a balanced diet, with a vari-
ety of foods from the food groups, and has one additional meal 
in addition to the 3 meals she receives daily. The fourth meal 
caters to her physiological needs.
• Pregnant women should take iron and folate tablets daily in addition to foods rich in iron, calcium and vitamin A.
KEY MESSAGES 
• Ensure that a breastfeeding mother take a balanced diet and in addition to 3 meals daily receives 2 extra meals a day to main -
tain her health and that of her baby.
• A pregnant woman and breastfeeding mother should eat a variety of foods from the main food groups daily.Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers36
Picture 7: A pregnant woman and a breastfeeding mother should eat a variety of 
foods from the food groups, extra meals and take iron and folate daily.
Nutrition 	for	children	0	to	6	months
Breastfeeding and complementary feeding behaviours are important predictors of infant and child nutrition, health and survival. Breast milk is the best food for babies and is all the baby needs up to six months of age. Children from birth to six months of age should be exclusively breastfed. If you introduce any food before six months you will poten-tially expose the baby to unsafe and poor quality meals.
Exclusive breastfeeding refers to feeding a child on breast milk only for 
the first six months. Mothers are advised to breastfeed their babies as many times as the baby demands to be fed (at least 8 times a day, every 2–3 hours). This will help maintain milk production. Even when the child is ill, continue breast feeding.Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers37Picture 8: A mother breastfeeding her baby and hand expressing her milk to leave 
for the baby when she is away.KEY MESSAGES 
• A baby from birth to 6 months of age should be fed only on 
breast milk and no other milk or foods.
• A breastfeeding mother should take a balanced diet and in ad -
dition to 3 meals daily should eat 2 extra meals a day to main -
tain her health and that of her baby.
Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers38Advantages 	of	breastfeeding
• Breast milk is the best nutritionally balanced food for the baby. It 
contains all the nutrients required by the baby in the correct pro-
portions. The nutrients are in forms that are easy for the baby to 
digest and absorb.
• Breast milk contains substances that help the baby to fight infec -
tions and stay healthy. Most of these substances are found in the 
yellowish milk (colostrum) that is produced in the first few days 
afterbirth.
• Breast milk is released at a correct temperature suitable for baby.
• Breast milk is safe, there is no danger of contamination during preparation.
• Breast feeding is relatively cheap compared to other alternatives.
• Breast feeding promotes bonding between mother and baby.
• Delays return of menstruation and delays the next pregnancy there-by spacing the children.
• Helps the mother to shrink the uterus back to its normal size.
• Exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months helps a child’s mental (brain) development.
SUMMARY
• Exclusive breastfeeding is the safest and healthiest way to feed a baby for the first 6 months.
• Babies need to be breastfed 8–12 times a day after every 2–3 hours or more as needed, in the first six months.
• Mothers should continue to breast feed their babies up to the age of 2 years or more even after introducing complemen-
tary feeding (weaning). Give food daily according to age, for 
example:
• 6–8 month: feed 2–3 times a day
• 9–11 month: feed 3–4 times a day
• 12–24 month: feed 4–5meals a dayFood and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers39Weaning/complementary 	feeding	practices
Weaning is the gradual introduction of food into the diet of the child. 
Alongside breast milk at the age of six months, beyond 6 months, breast milk alone is not enough to meet the child’s increased nutritional needs 
for proper growth and development. During weaning there are six princi -
ples to follow: meal frequency, amount, thickness, variety, active feeding 
and hygiene. This is commonly referred to as the FATVAH.
1. Frequency of meals refers to the number of meals eaten in a day. In 
order to meet the child’s body’s needs, for growth, development, and activity, we must feed them frequent meals, meaning 3 meals and 2 
snacks each day.
2. Amount of foods refers to how much food is eaten at each meal. It is 
important to eat foods in the appropriate amounts, again to ensure that 
we are not getting too little or too much food. For example, the youngest child needs less while the eldest child needs more amount of food for each meal as shown on table 3.
3. Thickness of foods/consistency (not too thick as to have difficulty 
chewing or swallowing, not too watery). The thickness of foods/ consis -
tency is an important factor to eating well, because if food is too thick, 
it might make it difficult to chew and swallow. However, if food is too watery, the energy value of the food is reduced.
4.	V ariety 	of 	diff erent 	f oods 	from each food group. In session 2 we 
learned about the food groups and their importance. We now know 
that each food serves the body differently (“GO”, “GLOW”, “GROW”), 
therefore it is important to have a variety of foods from each food group 
in order to eat well. Use fortified foods, when available; give vitamin/mineral supplements when animal products, fortified foods, or micronu -
trient (vitamin A, Fe & Zn) rich foods are not readily available.
5.	Activ ely 	f eed 	and 	support  is important, particularly for PLHIV. This is 
more than just feeding PLHIV (both adults and children), but involves a 
number of actions to support PLHIV to have access to food, grow foods, 
and prepare these foods.Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers406. Food Hygiene. Proper hygiene practices will prevent disease occur -
rences and hence ensure good child growth and development: washing 
hands before eating and handling foods, clean utensils and clean water. This is a very important factor needed for eating well. Good hygiene 
reduces the risk of diseases.

KEY MESSAGES 
• From 6 months and beyond, children should be fed on other 
foods on top of the mother’s breast milk. Milk should form the 
foundation of the child’s diet between the ages of 0 to 2 years.
• Use biofortified and/or fortified foods, when available; give 
vitamin/mineral supplements when animal products, fortified 
foods, or micronutrient (vitamin A, Fe & Zn) rich foods are not 
readily available.Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers43CHAPTER FIVE
WATER, SANITATION AND HYGIENE 
PRACTICES (WASH)
WASH practices help to prevent caregivers and other house hold 
members from contracting water-related diarrhoea diseases and 
associated food borne diseases. A healthier and stronger household is 
more economically viable and resilient in the face of nutritional chal -
lenges. WASH practices benefit everyone, and integrating these prac-
tices into nutrition care programs provides additional opportunities and 
resources to improve overall health outcomes.
Water access
• Access to safe water is considered a basic human need and, in most 
countries, a basic human right.
• For many people especially in rural communities, there is lack ac-cess to safe water.
• The negative effects of lack of access to sufficient quantities of water, water of reasonable quality, basic sanitation and hygiene are 
magnified for sick people including the malnourished clients.
• The added burden of unsafe water affects not only the malnour -
ished individual, but the entire family, increasing the risk of diar -
rhoea disease and lost productivity.
Water quality
• Piped water is available in some areas, but is often untreated or is 
contaminated between the source and the home.
• Simple, low cost technologies for treating and safely storing water at the household level can greatly improve the microbial quality of 
water and can significantly reduce diarrhoea achieving outcomes 
comparable to those achieved by hand washing and safe handling 
and disposal of faeces.
• Several technologies are viable for treating water in the home: chlo -
rination; use of aqua safe and water guard, use of various types of 
filters; proper boiling.Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers44
Picture 12: Making drinking water safe through boiling and keeping drink water 
covered and safe, cover water containers, wash hands after visiting toilet and always 
wash fruits before giving to child.• All drinking water should be boiled including water harvested from 
iron sheet-roofed houses and from the trees.
Hand washing
If done properly and at critical times, washing hands with soap or an 
abrasive substance such as is effective in preventing diarrhoea.
Food hygiene
Although statistics of food borne illnesses are scanty in Uganda, many people die as a result of diarrhoea disease cases. These are attributed to contaminated food or water, universal precautions apply to food handling like washing of raw fruits and vegetables.
Good practices to improve food hygiene
• Wash hands thoroughly before handling, preparing and eating food.
• Wash the knives, chopping boards and all surfaces thoroughly with 
clean water before and after use.
• Prepare and serve food when hot or warm.Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers45
Picture 13: Washing utensils; an example of proper hygiene practices.
• Always boil/reheat left over food thoroughly before eating. Cover 
well all the foods in the house away from flies and other pests.
• Keep the kitchen very neat.
• Keep cooked food away from contact with raw food.
• Avoid eating mouldy or rotten food.
• Avoid taking oil seeds whose skin has been cracked, e.g., ground -
nuts, soybeans.
• Wash vegetables with plenty of water at least three times before cutting it.
• Avoid taking raw or partially cooked foods of animal origin.
• All food grains and seeds such as maize and groundnuts should be properly dried and stored in a dry place. Use clean stores for storing 
foods.
KEY MESSAGE 
Always follow recommended postharvest handling measures given 
by agricultural extension officers in your area, when drying and storing foods.Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers46Picture 14: Food hygiene and safety is one of the main ways of preventing infections: 
washing fruits before slicing and eating them. Note: also a clean and well organized kitchen.
Kitchen and housekeeping
• The kitchen and house should be kept clean because it can be a seri-
ous cause of food contamination if it is not well tended to.
• The inside of the house should be kept neat and invitingly well orga-nized/arranged to allow thorough cleaning.
• The kitchen should have a door for the safety of the items kept there.
• Keep the inside of the house tidy by regular cleaning.
• It should have good ventilation to avoid growth of fungi and mould.
• There should be a simple rubbish bin for putting in refuse before disposal into the compost pit. The rubbish bin should have a cover.
• Use fuel saving stoves.
• Do not sleep with animals in the same house.
• If the house is not cemented, it should be smeared at least once a month.Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers47Proper refuse disposal
Wastes and kitchen refuse should not be littered everywhere in the 
compound lest flies will be invited.
• Use a garbage bin/pit for the disposal of wastes generated in the 
home.
• A compost pit should be dug in the kitchen’s vicinity to accommo-date kitchen and house refuse.
• Garbage should be burnt or buried in garbage pits to avoid breeding grounds of pests and rodents.
• Before disposal to the compost pit nondegradable garbage such as polythene bags should be separated out and preferably recycled in 
the appropriate facility.
• Compost manure from these pits can be used for agricultural pur -
poses to improve soil fertility. This in turn is nutrition advantageous.
Sanitation
• Children are particularly susceptible to contracting diarrhoea when 
any faecal matter is presenting the environment and may lead to 
malnutrition.
• Safe handling and disposal of faeces can reduce the risk of diar -
rhoea disease.
• Latrine should be located at least 6 meters away from the main 
house and routinely maintained and roofed:
• Kept clean and free from flies by routine sweeping and smoking, or by applying used car oil.
• Have a door and a cover for the latrine hole. Improved latrines, e.g., Ventilated Improved Pit (VIP) latrines are recommended.Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers48
 
Picture 15: Examples of proper hygiene practices. Washing hands after 
visiting toilet.
 A locally fabricated hand washing facility (tippy tap) should be strategi-
cally positioned near the latrine for hand wash water and soap/ash after visiting the latrine.
A clean, organized home environment prevents us from diseases, keeps us comfortable and adds beauty and scenic appeal to our homes. When diseases occur, they directly and negatively affect the nutritional status of a person no matter how well fed he/she was. It is possible to attain good standards of hygiene and sanitation regardless of where we live and under what conditions we live in. By maintaining a clean environ -
ment through practicing proper sanitation and hygiene, we prevent many infections and therefore save on resources (money, energy and time for treatment). Prevention is better than cure:
• Ensure good personal hygiene by regularly bathing, washing your 
clothes, trimming hair and nails.
• The home surrounding should be kept clean by:
• Sweeping the compound every day.
• Keeping grass low.
• Draining all stagnant water around the house to keep away the mosquitoes.
• Building animal houses.Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers49

KEY MESSAGE 
In addition to the balanced diet, ensure an organized, clean health environment at household and consumption of safe food for all household members.Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers50CHAPTER SIX
AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES THAT PROMOTE 
HOUSEHOLD FOOD SECURITY AND 
NUTRITION
Nutritionally friendly agriculture technology practices are very 
important in diversifying the household food and nutrient intake and 
also ensure that at least each meal the family is served has a protective, body building and energy giving food groups.
Nutritional well-being requires access to enough nutritious and safe food 
to meet the dietary needs of all members of the household throughout the year. Attaining better food supplies and nutritional well-being is more than just producing enough food locally. It also requires sufficient resources (such as land and labour), tools, skills and knowledge. Roads and transport to markets are necessary so that food and other essentials can be traded. Also, household members can find employment as well as have access to other commercial and government services.
For enhanced nutrition, agricultural practices that promote increased 
production and access of highly nutritious foods are emphasized in the community. Likewise, quality and safety of food produced should be maintained throughout the entire value chain. Good Agricultural Prac-tices (GAP), Good Hygiene Practices (GHP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) prevent foodborne diseases attributed to livestock and crops.
Zoonotic diseases such as salmonellosis are from eggs, brucellosis and 
tuberculosis from milk and meats and aflatoxin from maize and ground -
nuts should also be prevented.
It is therefore important to have built-in nutrition consideration that 
ensures access, safety and stability of nutritious foods.Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers51Nutrition-friendly agricultural practices can be divided into three broad 
areas:
A) PLANNING FOR NUTRITION FRIENDLY AGRICULTURE: NEEDS IDENTIFICATION
The process of identification of farmer needs is the first entry point for integration of nutrition services. Farmers should be provided nutrition 
information and facilitated to articulate nutrition sensitive requirements 
during this process.
Keys	considerations
Quality of farming inputs: Encourage farmer group to plan for diver -
sified inputs which are nutrient rich including fruits and vegetables; 
biofortified foods; animal source products.
Ensure	Male 	and 	f emale 	in volvement 	in 	participa tory 	planning 	(f armer 	
group discussions):  In Uganda women provide the majority of the labour 
force in agriculture and are basically the caregivers in homes including 
all aspects of child feeding and home management. Therefore they need 
deliberate targeting to increase farm productivity and adaption of posi -
tive childcare practices. However, they also need support of their male counterparts to ensure home harmony and sustained change.
Involvement of the most vulnerable farming households: Traditional 
extension had ignored these categories because they don’t easily adapt 
the technologies being promoted. This further increases their vulnera-
bility to malnutrition. They need consideration and deliberate targeting.
Labour saving technologies: Provision of agriculture labour has a direct 
effect on childcare practices within the agricultural households. Usually 
caregivers in agriculture households leave children under the care of older siblings; may have one meal a day which contributes to the poor nutrition status of children. Planning should focus on adoption of labour saving technologies to free time for provision of child care.
Involvement of the youth: Uganda has a younger population and the 
youth are the majority in most communities. This same group typically 
rejects careers in the agriculture and food system. Involvement of the Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers52youth is critical in building the next generation of agricultural leaders 
and thus creates sustainable change in the community.
Nutrition 	and	agricultur e 	in formation 	sharing: 	During planning ensure 
that farmer groups provide a forum to discuss nutrition issues; groups can set rules ensuring all members practice essential nutrition actions (refer 
to chapter 3). Groups can buy labour saving technologies to address the 
issues of labour and child care; and empower farmers to demand for 
appropriate nutrition advice and information. Extension workers should train farmers to identify and articulate their nutrition needs.
Selection 	of 	en terprise 	mix es 	tha t 	ha ve 	a 	high 	nutritio n 	impact: 	There 
is a tendency to focus of high yielding and profitable products in farming 
as a business. The prioritization and allocation of enterprises (zoning) 
across Uganda has emphasized food availability and commercialization 
with minimal emphasis on nutrition security. Extension workers should encourage and ensure farmers’ enterprise selection provides for both nutrition and income generation benefits.
Enterprise mixes with potentially strong nutrition impacts should have a 
mix of the following characteristics in addition to the high market poten-
tial:
• Provision of nutrients which are commonly deficient in the commu-
nity for example orange fleshed sweet potatoes, fruits, vegetables, 
small animals and others.
• Ensure the selected enterprise mix and/or actions along the value 
chain have inbuilt childcare considerations, e.g., reduction, of wom-
en’s workload to free time for childcare, promotion of community 
based childcare centres as part of agricultural development pro-
grams, promotion of household level income generation activities 
for women such as cottage level agroprocessing and others.
• Promote agricultural enterprise mixes and/or actions along the val-ue chain that ensures table food availability and more frequent flow 
of incomes for households (weekly or monthly).
• Promote production practices that protect the environment and/or 
reduce natural risks, e.g., climate change associated risks.Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers53• Have inbuilt food safety considerations and control of diseases as -
sociated with agricultural systems (for example aflatoxin, zoonoses, 
bilharzias and others).
• Promotion of enterprise mixes and marketing systems that increas-
es the participation and ownership/stake of the poor and other 
vulnerable groups along the value chain activities.
SUMMARY
• Train farmers to articulate their nutrition related needs during 
the planning process.
• Equal male and female involvement in selection of agriculture and nutrition farm needs.
• Ensure/encourage diversification of farm needs to include both animal and crop products.
• Built-in child care considerations as part of enterprise mix design.
• Quality of farming inputs for improved nutrition.
• Involvement of the most vulnerable farming households in agricultural development activities.
• Select enterprise mixes that maximize both income and nutri -
tion outcomes.
• Integration of ENA in agricultural extension system.
B) NUTRITION SENSITIVE AGRICULTURE PRODUCTION 
PRACTICES
There are 6 Sensitive Agriculture Production Key Practices:
1.  Pr oduction of a variety of crop and animal source foods for nutrient 
dense diet.
2.  Adop tion of farming systems that conserve the environment and 
promote nutrition.
3.  Pr omote use of labour saving technologies.Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers544.  Con trol diseases, agricultural chemical and veterinary drug residues 
associated with food production systems.
5.  In tegrate gender consideration in agricultural production practices.
6.  Design enterprise mixes or farming systems with inbuilt risk mitiga -
tion (market and natural/environment risk) especially for the vulner -
able groups.
1)	Pr oduction 	of 	a 	v ariety 	of 	cr op 	and 	animal 	sour ce	f oods 	f or 	nutri -
ent-dense diet.  The farmers should be encouraged to provide land for 
raring animals/small livestock and for crop productions of home crops 
such as fruits and vegetables which are high in nutrients yet require limited agriculture inputs. Fruits and vegetables are high yielding, require limited space and can be used for a variety of cropping systems selected by the farmers. Examples of these farming systems that promote diver -
sified production are hedge gardening and kitchen gardening for fruits and vegetables:
• It is advisable that food be grown on fertile soils that are rich in 
nutrients.
• Proper timing of planting, weeding, irrigation, pests and disease control and other important farming practices.
• Foods rich in protective nutrients (vitamins and minerals) should be produced: These include orange fleshed sweet potato varieties 
(OFSP which is rich in vitamin A), iron rich beans, carrots rich in vi -
tamin A, pumpkin seed rich in zinc, dark green leafy vegetables and fresh fruits rich in vitamins.
• Foods rich in protein from crops source such as high quality protein 
maize (QPM) and legumes especially soya bean. Foods rich in pro-
tein from animal source (those which can easily be kept by women 
or children for consumption or sold in the market to earn cash for 
household health expenditure without exciting men to resist). These 
include: poultry, rabbits, guinea pigs, fish farming, goats and pigs.
• Foods rich in proteins such as insects (grasshoppers, white ants, caterpillars, termites) should be promoted.
• Encourage kitchen gardens and growing of fruits as part of local gov -
ernment bylaws. Integrate nutrition along the strategic agricultural 
value chains by promoting the production of biofortified food variet -Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers55ies for the selected strategic enterprises, e.g., vitamin A and protein 
rich maize, iron rich beans, vitamin A rich bananas and cassava.
2)	Ado ption 	of 	f arming 	s ystems 	tha t 	c onserve 	the 	en vironment 	and 	
promote	nutrition.  Intercropping or crop rotation is one of the farming 
systems that has soil health and nutrition benefits. Legumes are ideal 
for intercropping with other crops because they fix nitrogen in the soil 
resulting in high yields from improved soil health. Others include:
• Agroforestry
• Integrated farming systems (animal & plants)
• Soil and water conservation practices
• Organic/sustainable agriculture
3) Promote use of labour saving technologies. The use of labour 
saving technologies such as rain water harvesting; use of animal trac-
tion (ploughing, carrying manure/ mulch, water, firewood and harvest), improved cooking stoves, planting of woodlots, minimum tillage (use of pesticides and herbicides) will reduce women workload and allow ample time for child care.
4) Control diseases, agricultural chemical and veterinary drug resi -
dues	associa ted 	with 	f ood 	pr oduction 	s ystems. 	These diseases can be 
broadly classified as follows:
• Water-associated/waterborne diseases caused by use of contami-
nated water from faecal material (cholera) and chemical intoxica-
tion. In addition, diseases caused by vectors living in stagnant water 
and or storage systems (Malaria, schictosomiasis/bilharzia worms, 
River blindness).
• Zoonoses diseases are diseases transmitted from animals to human 
being. Examples include: tuberculosis, brucellosis, salmonellosis, rabies, SARS/avian influenza and ebola.
Control of these diseases is important because they can be trans -
mitted to human beings, imposing on them poor health and atten-
dant undesirable nutrition related effects including the disease 
burden.Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers56• Occupational disease  and drug resistance as a result of exposure to 
range of antibiotics used in animals leading to drug resistant bacte -
ria in humans.
• Foodborne diseases such as diarrhoea, toxins and chemical hazards 
associated with food are also important health threats, and in many 
cases can be prevented only by farm-level intervention.
5)	In tegrate 	g ender 	c onsideration 	in 	agricultur al 	pr oduction 	pr actices.  
It is important that both men and women of working age and of all cate-
gories, including youth and persons with disabilities participate in agri-cultural processes to ensure.
• Production decisions are made in a participatory manner and selec-
tion of enterprises addresses both commercial and nutrition needs.
• Land is made available for both commercial and nutrition oriented production.
• Equitable sharing of roles to ensure women are freed from overbur -
dening work load.
• Dialogue on what and how much to sell and how much to keep for household consumption.
• Dialogue on how to utilize agricultural income in a manner that con -
tributes to better nutrition while not ignoring competing needs.
6)	Design 	en terprise 	mix es 	or 	f arming 	s ystems 	with 	built -in 	risk 	mitig a-
tion (market and natural/environment risk) especially for the vulnerable 
groups. This will include enterprise diversification producing a product that has markets in domestic, regional and if possible international market:
• Promotion of crops and animals that are resistant to adverse effects 
of climate change.
• Promotion of urban farming for the vulnerable households in the target areas.
• Establishment of school, and home orchards and gardens.
• Integrating community based food security information system as part of agricultural extension programs design to track food avail -
ability and access for the vulnerable groups.Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers57•  Design of agricultural enterprise mixes or value chains that ensure 
stable food availability throughout the year, more active participa-
tion of the vulnerable groups and/or more frequent flow of incomes 
for those households.
SUMMARY
• Promote the production of a variety of crop and animal source foods to ensure a diversified diet.
• Control diseases associated with agriculture systems.
• Promote use of labour and energy saving technologies.
• Integrate gender consideration in agricultural production.
• Adoption of farming systems that conserve the environment and promote nutrition.
• Design enterprise mixes or agricultural value chains with in -
built risk mitigation (market and natural/environment risk).
C) NUTRITION CONSIDERATIONS IN HARVEST AND 
POSTHARVEST HANDLING
Agriculture produce in Uganda can be classified into three categories based on their degree of perishability:
1) Durable produce (cereals, legumes, coffee)
2) Semi-perishable (roots and tubers, bananas)3) Perishable produce (meat, milk, fruits and vegetables)
Harvest and postharvest handling practices for cereals, legumes, fruits 
and vegetables in Uganda are characterized by traditional practices that result in considerable deterioration in the physical and nutritional quali -
ties of the harvested produce resulting in high losses.
Promotion of market oriented agriculture has resulted in increased 
production; however limited emphasis has been placed on reducing postharvest losses and increasing shelf life to ensure availability during lean periods. Postharvest losses in quality and quantity may be attrib -Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers58utable to absence of adequate processing and preservation facilities 
among farming households; poor handling during loading and unloading at market points; bruising, puncturing, and crushing due to improper packing; absence of grading especially for fruits and vegetables and 
inadequate knowledge among farmers on cottage processing. Reten-
tion of physical and nutritional qualities of agricultural produce can be 
ensured by developing appropriate and improved postharvest handling, storage and cooking. This keeps consumers healthier and improves the marketability of farm produce.
Promote	harvesting 	at	the	correct	maturity	stage
• Harvest food at the right stage of maturity to ensure maximum 
nutrient availability, e.g., most fruits and vegetables have greater 
vitamin content if they are picked ripe from the plant, rather than 
being picked before they have fully ripened.
• Over ripening of fruits will reduce the nutritional quality of fruits.
• Avoid physical and mechanical damages during harvesting to ensure longer storage and safe food following the harvest.
• Early planting prevents nuts from maturing during periods of low rainfall, which stresses a plant and encourages growth of the fungus 
on ripening crops.
Cleaning
• Drying of produce should be done on a clean and dry surface to 
avoid moisture and reduce the risk of contamination. As much as 
possible tarpaulins should be used.
• It is recommended that drying is done on a raised platform, one 
(1) meter above the ground to reduce contamination from animals 
passing by.
Discourage 	processing 	practices	that	produce	microbial 	
contaminate of the agricultural harvest
• Ensure crop is not left on the ground or on bare soil during drying, 
shelling and threshing, where fungal spores develop. The practice of 
moistening the unshelled nuts to make them easier to shell results 
in higher contamination from aflatoxin and should therefore be 
strictly discouraged.Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers59• Clean and sort to remove broken kernels, foreign matter, and diseased 
and rotten foods (grains, nuts, fruits, vegetables); these attract mois -
ture and pests leading to spoilage and/or fungal growth.
• Ensure crops are properly dried immediately after harvesting; howev -
er, drying will not reverse the effect of poison in the already contam-
inated foods, but it may inhibit further growth of moulds and other 
microbes.
Promote	good	storage	practices	to	protect	the	nutrient	content	
of the foods
• Proper storage spaces should have clear pathways to allow good air -
flow; ensure timely pest control interventions; ensure that grains are 
bagged in natural fibre bags for storage (not plastic). Improved storage 
and storage techniques can increase availability of nutritious foods 
during the lean season, reduce food safety concerns such as aflatoxin 
and increase marketability and trade in nutritious foods.
Distribution 	
• Distribution should also ensure that risks of contamination are re -
duced. For example, containers should be clean and dry.
Household 	agroprocessing 	and	value	addition
• Household or on-farm processing gives food security and nutrition benefits in addition to higher, potentially stable and regular incomes.
• Simple/hand coffee processing tools will ensure that coffee husks remain and act as manure for crop enterprises.
• Many foods that are transported to the urban centres and other markets in their very fresh forms result in considerable soil nutrient 
mining of the production areas and burdening of the waste disposal 
systems in the target markets. A case in point is the banana market in 
Uganda.
KEY MESSAGE 
Promote household/cottage level agriculture value addition for better 
incomes and as part of sustainable agricultural production systems for improving food security and nutrition.Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers60SUMMARY
• Minimize storage losses attributable to harvesting, weevils 
and farm processing.
• Harvest food at the right stage of maturity (avoid harvesting immature or over-mature produce in case of fruits don’t har -
vest under ripe or over ripe ones).
• Avoid physical or mechanical damage during harvesting, transportation and handling of foods.
• Avoid drying, shelling, threshing and winnowing food on bare ground (problems with contamination by microorganisms, 
sand and stones).
• Sort and clean the food to remove diseased and poor quality 
produce and impurities.
• Make sure that the produce is prepared under hygienic condi -
tions all the time.
• Recommended storage practices are very important for both perishables (fresh fruits and vegetables, meat, fish, poultry 
and eggs) and non-perishables like cereals and legumes).
• Maintain hygienic environment wherever food is produced 
and handled.
• Practice appropriate food preservation in homes, e.g., drying, smoking or salting of meat and fish, preservation of fruits and 
vegetables by use of solar drying.
• Discourage processing practices that contaminate the agricul-
ture harvest.
• Promote good storage practices that ensure safe and nutri -
tious foods.
• Not all food should go to the market.
• Use income from non-food items to buy food.Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers61D) FOOD SAFETY IN AGRICULTURE
Issues of food safety are gaining prominence each and every day world -
wide because of urbanization, changing food habits, preferences, life-
styles and food preparation methods. Street foods, food vending, restau-rants and hotels have become quite common of recent.
Food becomes unsafe for human consumption when the concentrations 
of the following (referred to as hazards) are above tolerance levels:
• Microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, viruses), parasites
• Biological toxins such as mycotoxins
• Physical materials like metal chips, sand, faecal material, stones
• Chemical residues including heavy metals such as lead, mercury, 
copper and others
Microorganisms including (bacteria, fungi, viruses) are the leading cause 
of food poisoning in the world. Physical aspects of food items affected by 
microbial activity with potential toxin formation include the following:
• Discoloration
• Mouldy and other unpleasant tastes
• Production of off odour
Aflatoxins caused by the moulds of aspergillusspp are especially asso -
ciated with occurrence of liver cancer in humans. There is also growing 
evidence that aflatoxins and mycotoxins in general can lead to reduced 
immunity and other associated effects such as incidence of HIV/AIDS and 
undernutrition. It is also linked to negative outcomes in animal growth 
and reproduction. Aflatoxins are commonly found in human food and animal feeds in the humid conditions of the tropics.
What is food safety?
Food safety describes a process where food is free from hazardous contaminants and when eaten will not cause damage or disease to 
human beings. Food safety is the protection of consumers from injury 
or adverse health effects caused by consuming or handling spoilt, adul -
terated or badly stored foods. Generally, food safety describes the 
handling, preparation and storage of food in ways that prevent food Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers62borne illnesses. This includes a number of routine activities that should 
be followed to avoid potentially severe health hazards.
Food safety is a public health priority because millions of people world -
wide fall ill every year and many die as a result of eating unsafe food.
Importance of food safety in Uganda
• As the country develops, an increasing percentage of the population 
is eating food prepared from outside the home or at least processed 
away from home. The majority of the market participants in the 
food industry are not aware of food safety issues and this is increas-
ingly exposing the population to unsafe food consumption.
• Current practices of food production, postharvest handling, process-
ing, packaging, transportation, retailing and food preparation in the 
homes, street food vending and some restaurants may lead to food 
becoming unsafe for consumption.
• Food safety related illnesses and problems such as cancer preva-lence are now a common occurrence in Uganda.
• Much of this burden of illness results from basic sanitation failures that occur in food production, processing, storage, transportation, retailing and handling in the home or streets, restaurants and ho -
tels.
Potential	hazards	associated 	with	food	in	Uganda
Microbial pathogens for example: salmonella, campylobacter and esch-
erichia coliare are associated with Diarrhoea diseases.
Zoonotic	diseases 	transmitted from animals to humans through food 
products, for example tuberculosis and brucellosis.
Parasitic	or ganisms , in particular cysticercosis, tape worms other intes-
tinal worms from poorly cooked pork or beef.
Naturally occurring toxicants for example, mycotoxins like aflatoxin.Agrochemical and veterinary drug residues that are used in crop agricul-
tural production including pesticides or animal production for example, antibiotics like tetracycline.Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers63Heavy metals such as lead and mercury that cause neurological damage 
in infants and children.
Physical contaminants and adulterants for example: glass, metal, animal 
faecal materials, sand, soil, stones, grass.
Food safety issues of concern in Uganda
Cereals & pulses: Groundnuts, Maize, sorghum contamination by afla -
toxin and Fusarium (fumonisins), this is highly prevalent but is not 
checked neither is there any regulation or control measures in place.
Dairy products: Brucellaabortus, Escherichia. Coli O157:H7, coliforms, 
tuberculosis are of interest. Dairy Development Authority and Uganda 
National Bureau of Standards laboratories carry tests for coliforms, Esch -
erichia coli , total plate count, salmonella and staphylococcus.
Fish: There is no published information on incidence of contamination 
risk in aquaculture. Tests are carried out by the fish laboratories at the 
Department of Fisheries Resources (DFR) MAAIF on Vibrio cholerae, 
Salmonella, poisoning using chemicals, lead, mercury, pesticides, Esch -
erichia coli , Salmonella  and Campylobacter .
Beef and Pork: Anthrax, Mycobacterium bovis, Tuberculosis, Brucellosis 
are the zoonoses of interest. Cysticercosis, trichinosis, Botulism, diseases arising from consumption of meat infected after slaughter with certain 
bacteria agents resulting into decomposition of meats. Cysticercosis 
(Taeniasolium) : in pork are tested for by municipal inspectors.
Water : Water quality testing is done by the National water laboratory 
under MoWE on microbes (Escherichia coli , coliforms and plate counts) 
and nutrient/organic matter. Heavy metals tests were to start in 2012 
when equipment was acquired, pesticides are not tested.
Methanol poisoning: methanol content exceeding acceptable levels.
Street vending: microbes, dust, storage, handling, sanitation and 
hygienic practices.Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers64Impact of food borne diseases
• Food borne diseases cause acute illnesses, disability and even early 
death.
• Increase the risk of chronic diseases such as cancer.
• Mostly affects children, pregnant women, the elderly and people already affected by other diseases.
• Food borne diseases significantly affect people’s health and wellbe-ing, reduce economic productivity resulting into a substantial burden 
on healthcare systems.
• Economic consequences for individuals, families, communities and 
businesses.
• Much of the burden of illnesses result from basic sanitation failures that occur in food production, processing, storage, transportation, 
retailing and handling in the home.
Effects	of	aflatoxin/mycotoxinson 	on	human	health	and	
agriculture
Mycotoxins are of economic, health and agricultural significance because:
• Mycotoxins can cause acute toxicity leading to death or chronic tox -
icity leading to liver cancers, immune suppression, Kwashiorkor and stunted growth.
• Mycotoxins are also harmful to animals for instance, in poultry pro-
duction, it reduces feed intake, reduces egg production, has carryover 
in eggs and meat and causes death.
• Aflatoxin, a type of mycotoxins which contaminates food has been as -
sociated with hepatoma (diseases of the liver) frequency in Uganda.
Action	areas	for	extension 	workers	and	others	on	food	safety
• Train/sensitize farmers, consumers and all stakeholders along the 
food value chain, on the need for good hygienic practices right from 
the farm at harvesting to drying, storing/processing and packaging, 
transportation and preparation of food.
• Impart Good Agriculture Production Practices (GAPP) and Good Man -
ufacturing Practices (GMP) among food value chain actors.Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers65Livestock 	production
• When animals have been treated with veterinary drugs, the drug 
withdrawal period for each drug should be observed before the an-
imals are sold for slaughter or the animal products such as milk are 
released for human consumption.
• The farmer should consult a veterinary doctor for guidance. If the animals or animal products are released for human consumption 
before the drug withdrawal period is over, the drug or its metabo -
lites is still in the animal/animal product and when consumed may lead to drug resistance in human or failure to respond usual human 
drug treatment.
• Animal products are highly perishable and germs easily multiply in them so should be properly handled and cooked before consump -
tion.
• Provide information/guidelines on the effect of poor handling of produce to various players throughout the value chain and how 
it can be prevented. Sustained public awareness campaigns are 
essential in order to improve the situation. Food quality along the 
value chain right from production through marketing to consump -
tion must remain a key element in the food security and nutrition agenda.
Recommended actions for aflatoxin prevention and or reduction in 
foods
• Aspergillusflavus fungus which produces aflatoxins grows best on 
maize at 18.0 to 18.5 percent moisture. Moisture content below 13 
percent prevents growth of Aspergillusflavus.
• After harvest, the moisture content of produce must be dried to 12 
to 14 percent for safe storage with minimum deterioration.
• Reducing drought stress through irrigation and limiting insect dam -
age by the application of good agricultural and pest control practic-
es, including use of high quality seeds is essential.
• Rapid drying limits aflatoxin proliferation for example, the piling of 
maize in stacks in the field extends drying time and therefore the 
potential for aflatoxins to be produced during the drying process. 
Wet-shelling of groundnuts prior to drying can also promote mould 
growth.Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers66• Greater use of wooden pallets for drying, natural fibre bags, hermet -
ic bags and various categories of insecticides could all help improve 
the quality of products and their readiness for storage.
• Proper produce storage practices. The ideal storage consists of dry, 
impermeable spaces kept at low temperature. If crops are kept on 
damp floors or in pits (even in bags) or humidity rises above 80 per -
cent, the likelihood of Aspergillus  growth and aflatoxin production is 
very high.
• Integrated pre and postharvesting interventions should be put into 
consideration because aflatoxins are heat stable, even dry roast -
ing does not remove aflatoxin contamination. Hand sorting at the 
household level may remove the worst (most mouldy) grain, seed 
contamination, but much of aflatoxin spoiled food is retained for 
consumption by households.
• Adoption of best practices requires education at all levels including: 
social marketing, awareness creation in media, awareness cam-
paigns on dangers and options at the household level, teaching at 
the farm and market levels (through extension and training), and 
promotion of risk minimization at industry processing (better under -
standing of use of screening critical control points) and retail levels.
KEY MESSAGE 
Agriculture interventions cannot ensure food security and nutri -
tion without considering food safety. Integrate food safety issues 
in the whole food value chain (production, postharvest handling, marketing and consumption) as part of increasing the nutrition sensitivity of agriculture activities.Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers67E) NUTRITION CONSIDERATION IN AGRICULTURAL 
MARKETING 
Marketing is key to agricultural production because without it there is 
no financial return on investment in agriculture. Marketing stimulates and sustains production. It is understandable when farmers seek to get 
market for their produce because it makes business sense. However 
marketing should not compromise household food security and nutri -
tion for the producer and consumer:
• Marketing should consider nutrition of the end user/consumer and 
thus packaging should be done in dry and clean packs/materials/
containers.
• For marketing to result in improved nutrition gender relations in the 
homes are very critical.
• Both men and women should participate in marketing of farm produce, but because gender relations are still complicated women 
could be allowed to be in charge of marketing traditional ‘low value’ 
crops.
• Women should also be allowed to have control and access of the incomes accrued from their participation in the marketing of foods.
• It is highly likely that women will use the incomes they have got from food sales to buy other nutritious foods for the whole house -
hold.
• Income from the sale of farm produce can be spent on a number of priority areas but food and dietary needs should not be compro-
mised.
KEY MESSAGE 
Agricultural marketing should ensure food and nutrition security 
for the producer and consumer. Gender relations are very critical in nutrition sensitive marketing.Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers68F) GENDER DIMENSIONS IN AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION
Gender describes the socially constructed roles, activities and responsi -
bilities assigned to women and men in a given culture, location and time. 
There is a difference between gender and sex.
Sex describes the biological and physiological differences between men 
and women while gender is a broader term defining cultural or social 
roles and expectations attached to men and women. Such roles and 
expectations vary from society to society and from time to time and impact on agricultural production and nutrition.
Manifestation of gender expectations and roles in agricultural 
processes
Sociocultural attitudes and perceptions influence how women and men 
perceive themselves and their roles in society consequently influence 
agriculture and nutrition outcomes. For example: women are respon -
sible for the bulk of food production but continue not to participate in 
most agricultural projects due to limited powers in influencing decisions that are taken at various levels.
• Yet few women own and control land but the majority can access it 
through their husbands or male relatives and thus utilize it accord-
ing to specific instructions. Such instructions may not necessarily 
guarantee food security and nutrition.
• Few women determine what enterprises to be done on the land
• Men decide cash crop enterprises while women may decide food crop enterprises.
• Food crop enterprises are restricted to small plots leaving the bigger portions for cash crops.
• Men are in charge of marketing most of the produce.
Implications of uneven role expectations
• Women are overwhelmed with productive and reproductive work.
• Women’s work load impacts on their capacity to pay adequate at -
tention to nutrition issues.
• Household food allocation expectations traditionally and culturally favour men and this adversely affects nutrition of women and chil -Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers69dren contributing to child malnutrition, child and maternal mortality 
and bad pregnancy outcomes such as obstructed labour, premature 
birth and low weight babies.
• Men dominate the marketing of farm produce and control incomes 
there from farm produce income, men are more likely to buy non-
food items.
Picture 17: The burden women face; excessive workload, frequent pregnancies 
home and child care.
What can be done to improve gender relations to favour agricultural 
production, food security and nutrition?
• Making sure that both women and men participate in agriculture 
technology transfer activities.Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers70• Facilitate the community to select enterprises that take care of both 
women and men needs.
• Women should be given power to access to information related to agriculture and health in order to help them care for the children 
and produce more food for the household.
• Men need to support women to reduce the work burden and free 
time for child care.
• Energy saving technologies should be adopted to free women from some of the work load to pay attention to nutrition issues of their 
children.
• Parents should be encouraged to educate both boys and girls 
because the ability to care for children is at times compromised by 
women’s lack of education, limited opportunities to earn income as 
well as lack of freedom outside the home.
• Women who are educated or at least literate easily care for their children and have a high possibility of having well fed children. Lack 
of self-esteem makes some women unable to take part in income 
generation activities. In addition, education further empowers 
women and makes them easily look for family planning services 
which can help space children.
• Well-spaced children will reduce burden on the women, improve care for both the mother and child and consequently improve nutri-
tion for the whole household.
• Extension workers should support farmers to select enterprises that 
promote household food security and nutrition and follow this up 
with adequate extension services.
• Women should be encouraged to take part in leadership roles and 
be part of the decision making process, even if it begins at village 
level. This will position women to articulate issues that promote 
food security and nutrition.
• Women should be encouraged to form and/or join savings and credit associations as this will ease their access to affordable credit 
to invest in agricultural production.Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers71Summary 	of	common	agricultural 	projects	or	actions	linked	to	
nutrition
• Backyard gardens for fruits, vegetable and herbs strategically placed 
near the home to enable easy watering using waste water during 
the dry season (picture 18).
• Rearing of small animal and birds such as poultry, fish, goats, pigs, 
guinea pigs and rabbits that can be reared in the backyard.
• Rearing local chickens are quite easy to keep by both women and children. They multiply very fast, supply high quality protein, have a good market potential and can be kept both for household nutrition 
and income generation.
• The kroiller birds adapted from India have both the characteris-
tics of the local chicken and the modern poultry breeds (picture 
18).
• Rabbits are very good for nutrition improvement. They multiply 
very fast, supply high quality body building foods and can easily 
be reared by children (picture 18).
• Zero grazing dairy enterprises especially under women groups.
• Built-in food safety nets actions that reduce risks.
• Household food processing and preservation technologies that 
increase availability, access, security and utilization of most deficient 
nutrients.
• Integrating gender and child care considerations in agricultural pro-
gram design and implementation.
• Encouraging the production, consumption and marketing of staple foods with high nutrition value, e.g., orange fleshed sweet potatoes, 
iron rich beans, soy beans, foods fortified with micronutrient, e.g., 
vitamin A fortified oil, vitamin A fortified flour and iron fortified 
flour.
• Giving special considerations for the participation and benefits 
access to vulnerable people such people living and affected by HIV/
AIDS, diabetes, cancer, infants, pregnant and lactating women, chil -
dren, the sick, the elderly, the displaced and the poor.
• Integrating nutrition education into agricultural extension programs.Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers72

Value of Porridge
How	to	further	boost	nutritive	value	or	food	value	of	porridge
• Add vegetable oil to porridge improve its energy value.
• Add eggs, milk to improve protein.
• Use of flour made out of sprouted and dried cereal grains like millet. 
The presence of amylase partially digests the complex and bulky 
carbohydrates and makes the porridge more energy dense.
• Add fruit juices like lemon, oranges, lime etc. just before serving 
porridge increases vitamin C value, palatability/ taste and enhances 
absorption of nutrients.
Porridge made from fermented cereals or legumes reduce incidence of 
diarrhoea during weaning. Addition of juice from fruits (ascorbic acid) to 
porridge greatly enhances absorption of minerals like iron and improves 
the taste. Such food preparation methods should be encouraged in the communities.
The advantages of sour and fermented porridge as a weaning food:
• It is more difficult for harmful bacteria to grow in. It keeps safely for 
2–3 days even in warm weather. It is therefore less likely to give a 
child diarrhoea than ordinary porridge.
• It is thinner and easier for a baby to eat and digest than plain por -
ridge.
• The absorption of non-haem iron, zinc and some other minerals is 
increased.
Suggestions 	for	stopping	the	child	from	breast	feeding
Complete withdrawal of a child from breast milk should be a slow and 
gradual process. Encourage the mother to systematically stop breast 
feeding by following the steps below:
• Make sure that the child continues to feed well at least four to five 
times a day.Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers84• If necessary, increase the amount of food and the number of meals 
that the child eats.
• Increase the length of time between breast feeds, so that the num -
ber of breast feeds decreases gradually.
• Apart from those times when you decide to breastfeed, avoid situa -
tions that make the child think of breastfeeding for example, having 
the child on her lap if she sits down to eat or to have a drink.
• The child should be given extra loving attention, and the child-moth -
er bond should be strengthened.
• Do not push the child away from the breast when she/he tries to 
breast feed as this may make the child feel anxious and unhappy.
• The mother should stop the night breast feeds last of all.
• Supervise the care and feeding of the child at all times.Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers85Annex	4.	Uganda	Nutrition 	Advocacy 	
Messages (PROFILES)
The productivity lost when agriculture workers take time off to deal with 
malnutrition-related illnesses or deaths in their families. The country losses about US$34 million worth of productivity because of iron defi-ciency anaemia among adults. Women of reproductive age with anaemia accounted for 75 percent, or US$25 million, of that loss. The total loss estimated at about 0.4 percent of the gross domestic product/GDP .
Stunting in early childhood affects productivity in adulthood. For every 1 
percent that the height of a child under 2 years of age is below the norm, the child’s productivity from manual labour as an adult declines by 1.4 percent. Uganda losses about US$210 million worth of productivity from childhood stunting. These two conditions alone (iron deficiency anaemia and stunting) are associated with productivity loss of about US$290 million per year (PROFILES, 2009).
Vitamin A deficiency, which affects mainly women and children in 
Uganda, increases the risk of blindness and susceptibility to diseases, mainly diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections in children. Children with vitamin A deficiency are 1.4 times more likely to die of these and other childhood illnesses than ones that are not deficient.
Iodine deficiency disorder (IDD), is the single most common cause of 
preventable mental impairment, brain damage, and physical disabili -
ties among children in Uganda. Women with IDDs give birth to children with reduced ability to learn, lower school performance, higher rates of school-age repetition, and poor speech and hearing ability. What is especially tragic is that the effects of iodine deficiency are permanent. Because of IDD, in the year 2009 alone, 2,100 children were born as cretins in Uganda and likely will require 100 percent care in their entire lives, 59,000 children were born with mild or moderate mental disabil -
ities and Uganda lost US$8.6 million in productivity (Uganda Profiles 2012).Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers86Annex 5. Technical Working Group for the

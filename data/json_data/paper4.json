Isolated from human urine and plasma in the year 2000 [1, 2], hepcidin appears\n \nTABLE 1. Dynamics of iron and hepcidin regulation\n\nAfferent: blood !\tLiver !\tEfferent: gut\n \nto be the long-sought iron-regulatory hormone responsible for the anaemia of chronic disease [3, 4]. It is more than that: it is an acute-\n \nStimulation or down-regulation\n \nHepcidin production\n \nAction on iron absorption in gut and immunity\n \nphase reactant, responding to infection and in\ufb02ammation [5]; it is\nan antimicrobial peptide that disrupts microbial membranes [1, 6]; and it provides an iron-restricted internal milieu inhospitable to microbes [7, 8].\nHepcidin is a 25 amino acid, 2\u20133 kDa, cationic peptide that has broad antibacterial and antifungal actions [1]. In concert with other antimicrobial peptides, known as defensins and cathelicidins [9], it provides a \ufb01rst line of defence at mucosal barriers [1, 2]. However, more germane for rheumatologists is its control of iron kinetics. Produced by hepatocytes, hepcidin inhibits the intestinal absorption [1, 10], macrophage release [3, 7] and placental passage\n[10] of iron. Hepcidin mRNA moves with the body\u2019s iron levels, increasing as they increase and decreasing as they decrease [11]. More pertinently, hepcidin rises with infection or in\ufb02ammation and falls with hypoxia or anaemia [12].\nThe anaemia of chronic disease has long confounded physicians. It is generally normocytic and normochromic, but may be hypo- chromic or microcytic [13]. The low serum iron and normal-to- low iron-binding capacity, in conjunction with a high-to-normal serum ferritin level in patients with in\ufb02ammatory disease, has been perplexing. Also notable has been the shortened red blood cell survival and blunted erythropoietin-induced production of red blood cells. At one time known as the anaemia of infection, it became known, after man\u2019s entry into the age of antibiotics, as the anaemia of chronic disease, and now, perhaps more aptly, it is the anaemia of in\ufb02ammation.\nIron can be toxic. It catalyses the generation of reactive free\nradicals [14] and activates NF-KB, the prototypic transcription factor for genes involved in in\ufb02ammation [15]. At high levels, iron is damaging to tissues. Humans need little dietary iron, 1\u20132 mg a day suf\ufb01cing for the average adult male [16]. However, mammals lack a regulated pathway for iron excretion [12], so iron absorption has to be tightly regulated. Hepcidin acts as a negative regulator of iron absorption: USF2 knockout mice lacking hepcidin mRNA become iron-overloaded [17]; transgenic mice with increased hepcidin expression die at birth with severe iron de\ufb01ciency [10]; humans with hepcidin-producing adenomas develop an iron-refractory iron de\ufb01ciency anaemia [4]; and gene mutations affecting hepcidin cause haemochromatosis in humans [18] and in mouse models [17].\nIn animals and man, the anaemia of in\ufb02ammation is due primarily to hepcidin-induced sequestration of iron in the macro- phage [18]. The link between in\ufb02ammation/infection and liver production of hepcidin is attributed to IL-6, produced at sites of infection/in\ufb02ammation [13]. Human hepatocytes increase hepcidin mRNA in the presence of IL-6 or lipopolysaccharide and in the presence of IL-6 produced by monocytes exposed to lipopolysac- charide [5]. Infection in one human subject reportedly increased excretion of hepcidin in the urine 100-fold [5]. Mice respond to the in\ufb02ammation generated by an injection of turpentine with a six- fold increase in hepcidin mRNA and a two-fold decrease in serum iron [10]. Remarkably, the white bass responds to infection with Streptococcus iniae with a 4500-fold rise in hepcidin mRNA expression [19].\n1323\n \n1.\tIn\ufb02ammation/infection\t\"\t# intake of Fe by gut\n\" IL-6\tAntibacterial in innate\nimmunity Sequestration of Fe in\nmacrophages reduces serum Fe\n2.\tBody Fe \"\t\"\t# intake of Fe by gut Haemochromatosis\nHaemosiderosis\n3.\tBody Fe #\t#\t\" intake of Fe by gut\nBleeding\tEgress of Fe out of\nmacrophage\n4.\tAnaemia, hypoxaemia\t#\t\" intake of Fe by gut\n5.\tErythropoiesis \"\t#\t\" intake of Fe by gut\n\n\n\nIn addition to iron levels and in\ufb02ammation/infection, there is another factor that affects hepcidin levels: it is anaemia. Along with hypoxia, anaemia overrides the effects of iron and in\ufb02ammation/infection, reducing levels of hepcidin mRNA [4, 12]. Were this not the case, in\ufb02ammation, by maintaining high hepcidin levels, would keep the haematocrit dropping. Instead, down- regulation of hepcidin mRNA expression by anaemia produces a new steady state, usually with haematocrits 3\u20135 points below normal.\nIn addition to disrupting bacterial membranes, hepcidin provides an inhospitable internal milieu for microbes that success- fully enter the bloodstream. Micro-organisms need iron [14]. Bacteria require iron for the production of the superoxide dismutase that protects them from host oxygen radicals [20, 21]. Hepcidin, by inducing macrophage sequestration of iron, robs bacteria of this element. Blood and intracellular bacteria [22] may weaken; bio\ufb01lms may not develop [7]. Pertinent here is the recent report of an inverse relationship between the incidence of tuberculosis and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) [23], raising the possibility that that the inaccessibility of iron in RA protects from tuberculosis [24].\nPallor, weakness and fatigue have been recognized as hallmarks of chronic disease for millennia. Anaemia obviously contributes to the pallor. Less obvious is whether the decrease in serum iron diminishes its availability to myoglobin and the enzymes catalysing the redox reactions required for the generation of energy (cyto- chromes) suf\ufb01ciently to contribute to weakness and fatigue.\nDefensins are antimicrobial peptides produced by cells of epithelial linings [9]. Hepcidin, like defensins, is an antimicrobial peptide that kills on contact. However, because it is produced by the liver, has not been found to have chemotactic properties, and differs structurally from defensins [25], it will likely be classi\ufb01ed as an acute-phase reactant [5].\nThe identi\ufb01cation of hepcidin opens the door to therapeutic approaches for several disorders and to proscriptions regarding the use of iron. Recombinant hepcidin may be the ideal therapeutic agent for those with some forms of juvenile haemochromatosis and\n \nRheumatology Vol. 43 No. 11 \u00a9 British Society for Rheumatology 2004; all rights reserved\n \n\n \nwith the less severe but more common form of haemochromatosis caused by mutations in the HFE gene [26]. Hepcidin-induced iron deprivation may prove helpful in preventing the development of resistant bacterial bio\ufb01lms [10]. For the anaemia of in\ufb02amma- tion, often resistant to erythropoietin therapy [27], inhibitors of hepcidin, by releasing sequestered iron, could restore haemo- globin levels and conceivably correct an iron lack in myoglobin and cytochromes as well. Finally, of related interest is a recent report that moderate alcohol intake reduces levels of C-reactive protein and IL-6 [28], the principle chemokine for the generation of hepcidin mRNA, extrapolating to a possible ameliorative role of alcohol in both in\ufb02ammation and the anaemia of in\ufb02ammation.\nAs to proscriptions, iron supplements should be monitored, not only because the resulting increase in hepcidin can fuel antimicro- bial engines unnecessarily, but because hepcidin increases macro- phage iron sequestration in the synovium as elsewhere. Synovial iron has the propensity to generate oxygen free radicals that have been linked to the chronicity and erosiveness of joint disease in RA [29]. In fact, intramuscular injections of iron have long ago been reported to cause acute \ufb02ares of joint in\ufb02ammation in RA [30]. A broader phlogistic potential of iron towards the joint comes from a recent report that iron depletion by serial phlebotomies diminishes recurrences of gouty arthritis [31]. If one adds all of the above to the reported links of iron suf\ufb01ciency to colon cancer [32], diabetes mellitus [33], chronic hepatitis [34] and atherosclerosis [35], it would seem best to phase out gratuitous iron supplementation altogether.\nThe discovery of hepcidin provides a thread that ties together the perplexing triad of decreased serum iron, increased macro- phage iron and chronic in\ufb02ammation. In addition, it offers a unique opportunity for determining the effects of iron on disease, the usefulness of hepcidin inhibitors or promoters to control iron kinetics, and the proper means of iron administration. In the aggregate, these will represent a step forward in the treatment of a variety of diseases.\nThe authors have declared no con\ufb02icts of interest.\n\nH. MCGRATH JR and P. G.

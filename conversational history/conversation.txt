user: what can i eat for inflammation?
bot:  Based on the text, some recommendations for foods that can help with inflammation include:

- Reducing intake of gluten and dairy, though further research is still needed on their exact role. It's best to consult a dietitian specialized in food intolerances before eliminating entire food groups.

- Choosing more plant-based proteins like legumes, lentils, nuts, seeds, tofu and whole soy foods over animal proteins. Plant proteins are shown to have an anti-inflammatory effect compared to too much animal protein.

- Increasing fiber intake slowly to avoid gastrointestinal issues. Fiber helps with firming stools and preventing blockages.

- Including anti-inflammatory whole foods as much as possible, like those containing antioxidants, polyphenols and phytoestrogens.

The text also discusses some anti-inflammatory supplements that may be helpful for some people, but recommends consulting a professional before starting supplements. Overall, an anti-inflammatory diet focused on whole plant foods is emphasized.

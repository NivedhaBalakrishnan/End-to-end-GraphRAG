They reside in tissues that primarily interface with the external environment. Activated mast cells respond to environmental cues throughout acute and chronic in\ufb02ammation through releasing immune mediators via rapid degran- ulation, or long-term de novo expression. Mast cell activation results in the rapid release of a variety of unique enzymes and reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, the increased density of mast cell unique receptors like mas related G protein-coupled receptor X2 also characterizes the in\ufb02amed tissues. The presence of these molecules (either released mediators or surface receptors) are particular to the sites of active in\ufb02ammation, and are a result of mast cell activation. Herein, the molecular design principles for capitalizing on these novel mast cell properties is discussed with the goal of manipulating localized in\ufb02ammation.\n\nStatement of signi\ufb01cance\n\nMast cells are immune regulating cells that play a crucial role in both innate and adaptive immune re- sponses. The activation of mast cells causes the release of multiple unique pro\ufb01les of biomolecules, which are speci\ufb01c to both tissue and disease. These unique characteristics are tightly regulated and afford a localized stimulus for targeting in\ufb02ammatory diseases. Herein, these important mast cell attributes are discussed in the frame of highlighting strategies for the design of bioresponsive functional materials to target regions of in\ufb02ammations.\n\u00a9 2023 Acta Materialia Inc.

Mast cell action can be both bene\ufb01cial and harmful to the host: the protection against pathogenic inva- sions [1,2], or being complicit in allergy and autoimmune diseases, respectively [3\u20136]. Primarily localized in tissues that contact the external environment, mast cell populations may differ from one tissue to another, and are dynamic in response to environmental cues. The number of mast cells in the tissue drastically increases during in\ufb02ammatory events, as observed in the: (i) airways and lungs of pulmonary vascular diseases (PVD) and asthmatic patients [7,8]; (ii) skin of atopic dermatitis patients [9\u201313]; (iii) synovial tis- sue of osteoarthritic patients [14]; and (iv) cancerous tissue during metastasis [15,16].

Mast cell activa- tion were thought to be orchestrated through the Fc\u025bRI, and other ligand speci\ufb01c receptors like Toll like Receptors (TLR), KIT receptor, and C5a and C3a complement receptors [20\u201322]. However, the re- cently identi\ufb01ed mas related G protein-coupled receptor X2 (MRG- PRX2) on mast cells has been shown to initiate mast cell activa- tion against a variety of endogenous and synthetic peptides, and approved drugs [23,24]. Few of the well characterized molecules that are released in the vicinity of in\ufb02amed tissue by the activated mast cells include: (i) pro-in\ufb02ammatory cytokines (interleukin (IL)\n- 4,5,6,15); (ii) tumor necrosis factor - \u03b1; (iii) vascular endothe-\nlial growth factors (VEGFs); (iv) biogenic amines (histamines); (v) tissue remodeling and chemoattractant proteases (tryptase, chy- mase, and carboxypeptidases); and (vi) pathogen neutralizing hy-\n \n\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.actbio.2023.01.024\n1742-7061/\u00a9 2023 Acta Materialia Inc.

Intra- and ex- tracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) are also formed during the acute activation of mast cells [29,30]. Adding to these, chronic mast cell activation concurrently leads to the de novo expression and release of cytokines, chemokines, and largely mast cell spe- ci\ufb01c enzymes, whilst increasing the density of mast cell receptors like Fc\u025bRI and MRGPRX2 [31\u201335]. Table 1 lists few of the various molecules that are released upon mast cell activation. Ultimately, the activation of mast cells leads to the release of a plethora of bioactive compounds that are spatiotemporally regulated to spe- ci\ufb01c in\ufb02ammatory processes, and that are tissue speci\ufb01c and work together to restore homeostasis. That said, these mast cell unique bioactive molecules that are only available depending on disease state and tissue location, provide unprecedented targets for biore- sponsive materials to modulate in\ufb02ammations.\nThe aim of the present review-cum-analysis is to highlight the discriminating mast cell characteristics speci\ufb01c to an in\ufb02amed tis- sue that is not present during healthy physiological conditions; and to discuss strategies to harness these differences in the microen- vironment for targeted therapies. We discuss here the increased concentration of mast cell released enzymes during in\ufb02ammation and survey their respective substrates for the express purpose of designing materials for therapeutic application. In addition to the enzymes, activated mast cells also witness elevated levels of intra- and extracellular ROS. Given the fact that ROS production, by mast cell or macrophage, occurs early in the in\ufb02ammatory response, it is possible to target local sites of in\ufb02ammation at the earliest stages. Consequently, the design and development of ROS respon- sive materials have also been discussed. Finally, the increased den- sity of mast cell MRGPRX2 receptor in diseased states have been discussed along with ideas on exploiting this receptor for targeted therapeutic approaches. The physiochemical characteristics of pep- tide ligands for MRGPRX2 is well elucidated, thus, their use as homing peptides to the in\ufb02amed tissue has been discussed.\n\n2.\tMast cell speci\ufb01c enzymes as in\ufb02ammatory stimulus\n\nMast cell activation results in the rapid release of preformed granular enzymes like \u03b2-hex, tryptase, and chymase, which have a speci\ufb01c and well-de\ufb01ned activity against a limited set of substrates (Fig. 1). Chronic activation of mast cells induces the de novo ex- pression and release of metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), among other mediators, which digests gelatin and collagen. Herein, these en- zymes and their substrates are discussed in terms of their use in developing bioactive materials to target regions of active in\ufb02am- mation.\n\n2.1.\tMast cell enzymes released via degranulation\n\n2.1.1.\tEnzyme composition, mast cell population and dynamics\n\u03b2-hex is a key marker of mast cell activation and is routinely used to study mast cell activation in the presence of any speci\ufb01c or general agonists [23,36]. Release of \u03b2-hex has been shown to be proportional to the concentration of agonist, where minutes af- ter activation 45 \u2013 62% of the 3.8 U of \u03b2-hex stored in the secre- tory granules of 106 lung mast cells is released, and \ufb01nally plateaus at 86% of the total granulated \u03b2-hex [37,39,54]. Furthermore, mast cells can resupply their compliment of bioactive molecules in the granules within a 24 h timeframe and can undergo successive de- granulation, releasing similar amounts of \u03b2-hex each time [38].\nMast cell degranulation also releases preformed tryptase and chymase into the tissue milieu. Though tryptase has also been shown to be expressed by monocytes and basophils, mast cell re-\nlease is the dominant source: monocytes predominantly release in- active \u03b1-tryptase, and basophil tryptase is < 1% of that contained\n \nin mast cells [40,55]. Mast cells are classi\ufb01ed into two subpopula- tions, viz., (i) MCTC \u2013 mast cell containing both tryptase and chy- mase, and (ii) MCT \u2013 mast cell predominantly containing tryptase [56]. Further, it has been shown that about 79% of total tryptase contained in human lung MCT cells are released upon the activa- tion [39]. When designing strategies for affecting localized in\ufb02am- mation through mast cell properties, it is important to recognize that mast cell subpopulations vary with tissue type. For example, MCTC are the dominant mast cell population in skin and intesti- nal submucosa, accounting for 89 and 87% of the total mast cell population respectively; on the contrary, lung and intestinal mu- cosa mast cells are predominantly MCT (\u223c100%) [41,56]. Moreover, the granular composition of serine enzymes have been shown to vary with tissue type; skin mast cells (106 cells) contain 35 and\n4.5 \u03bcg, while lung mast cells (106 cells) contain 10.8 and 0.3 \u03bcg of tryptase and chymase, respectively [42]. Differences in the relative composition of mast cell populations and their respective enzyme pro\ufb01les provide a novel design strategy for developing therapeutics that can be locally activated in speci\ufb01c in\ufb02amed tissues.\nMast cell populations are dynamic and vary with disease type and severity. For example, mast cell population transition from predominantly MCT in healthy subjects to MCTC in patients with asthma and pulmonary diseases, and the extent of this change is directly related to disease severity [7,8,43,44,57]. Situations like this provide a unique trigger for targeted release, where the tis- sue has elevated levels of chymase during the time for treating the\ndisease. On the contrary, osteoarthritis has an increased population of MCT (77%) cells in the human synovial tissue (81 in patients vs. 24-32 cells/mm2 in controls), compared to controls [14]. Similarly, human scar tissue has a dramatic increase in MCT skin mast cells, increasing to 91% from 11% in a normal skin tissue [41]. This is not always the case though and the mast cell pro\ufb01le for each dis- ease needs to be characterized. Tryptase, for example, though was at an increased level in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) \ufb02uid of patients with asthma when compared to the control, the relative level of tryptase did not change with disease severity [57]. These examples illustrate situations where chymase and tryptase levels vary depending on disease location and state, allowing for speci\ufb01c and local targeting of affected tissues.\n2.1.2.\tSubstrate considerations for \u03b2-hex\n\u03b2-hex is a lysosomal enzyme that promotes the hydrolysis of 1,4 glycosidic bonds in glycosaminoglycans [58]. Chitin, a \u03b2-1,4 glucoside linked N-acetylglucosamine polysaccharide, a microbial cell wall component, is therefore an ideal substrate for \u03b2-hex [59\u201361]. However, research has shown that \u03b2-hex only processes hydrolyzed colloidal and ground chitin (i.e., short chain chitin- oligosaccharides (COS)) [62,63]. The catalytic activity of the en- zyme sequentially removes monomers from the non-reducing end of the chain to furnish monomeric N-acetylglucosamine as the end product (Fig. 2) [62,64,65]. The kinetic parameters for mast cell sourced \u03b2-hex against COS has not been detailed, but \u03b2-hex de- rived from other sources have shown varying degradation kinetics for COS of 2 to 6 degrees of polymerization (DP). \u03b2-hex cloned from bacteria Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Vibrio harveyi had a Kcat/Km value of 246 and 166 M\u22121s\u22121 respectively for DP6 chitin; the Vmax and Km value for Vibrio furnissi \u03b2-hex against DP6 chitin was found to be 3.5 mM and 376 \u03bcmol-min\u22121mg\u22121, respec- tively [62,65,66]. The kinetic values were obtained for a range of pH between 5 to 8, and temperature between 30 to 40 \u0366C, mean- ing that this function could be expected in physiological situations with mast cell derived \u03b2-hex. Further, the catalytic activity of \u03b2- hex is mediated by the 2-acetamide group present in the monomer unit of its substrate, without which the enzymatic activity is inhib- ited (Fig. 2a) [58,64]. Chitin derivatives, like chitosan in its acety- lated form, and hyaluronic acid, thus are commonly engineered\n \n\n22\n \nTable 1\nMolecules released from mast cell upon activation.\n\n\nMediator (Type)\tMast Cell Source\tStimulus\tTime (min)\tTechnique used\tReference\n \n\u03b2-hex (Granular)\tLaboratory of Allergic Disease 2 (LAD 2)\tAntibody-Antigen (Ab-Ag), compound 48/80,\nMastoparan, Icatibant, Atracurium, Cipro\ufb02oxacin\n \n30\tColorimetry (hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl- N-acetyl-\u03b2-D- glucosaminide)\n \n[23]\n \nLAD 2\tPAMP-12\t30\t[36]\nRat serosal mast cell\tAb-Ag\t0\t[37]\nMouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (mBMMC)\tAb-Ag\t90\t[38]\nHuman lung mast cell\t\tAb-Ag\t\t\t5\t\t\t[39] Tryptase (Granular)\tHMC-1, human skin mast cell\t\tSolubilized by sonication\t\t\tNA\tELISA\t\t[40] Human skin mast cell\t\tPAMP-12\t\t120\tddPCR (TPSAB1 expression)\t[36]\nHuman scar tissue mast cell\tNA\tNA\tImmunostaining\t[41]\n \nHuman foreskin mast cell\tSolubilized by sonication\tNA\tELISA, colorimetry (hydrolysis of\ntosyl-L-Gly-Pro- Lys-p-nitroanilide)\nHuman lung mast cell\tAb-Ag\t5\tColorimetry (hydrolysis of tosyl- L-Arg-methyl ester)\nHuman lung mast cell\tSolubilized by sonication\tNA\tELISA, colorimetry (hydrolysis of tosyl-L-Gly-Pro- Lys-p-nitroanilide)\n \n[42]\n\n[39]\n\n[7]\n \n\n\nChymase (Granular)\n \nRat heart mast cell\tHeart surgery (transverse aortic constriction)\tNA\tImmunostaining, western blot, ELISA\t[26] LAD 2\tCovid spike protein\t120\tELISA\t[27] Human scar tissue mast cell\tNA\tNA\tImmunostaining\t[41]\n \nHuman foreskin mast cell\tELISA, colorimetry (hydrolysis of\nD-Suc-L-Ala-Ala- Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide)\n \n[42]\n \nHuman lung mast cell (from patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)\nHuman lung mast cell (from patients with congenital heart disease)\nHuman lung mast Cell (from patients with asthma)\nHuman lung mast cell (from patients with Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)\n \nhCMA1 expression\t[28]\n\nImmunostaining\t[8]\n\n[43]\n\n[44]\n \nRat Heart mast cell\tOvarian hormones\tPeriodic\tImmunostaining, western blot, ELISA\t[25] Rat Heart mast cell\tHeart surgery (transverse aortic constriction)\tNA\tELISA\t[26]\nLAD 2\tCovid spike protein\t120\t[27]\n \nMMP-9 (De Novo)\tHMC-1, human cord blood-derived mast cell\n(CB-HMC)\n \nPhorbol ester\t360\tRT-PCR, zymography\t[33]\n \nHuman skin mast cell\tNA\tNA\tImmunostaining Human lung mast cell (from patients with lung\ncancer)\nHuman synovial Membrane mast cell (from patients with rheumatoid arthritis)\nHuman synovial Tissue mast cell (from Patient with rheumatoid arthritis)\nHMC-1, CB-HMC\tCytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3 )\t240-1440\tRT-PCR, zymography\n \nMouse peritoneal cavity Mast cell (In\ufb02amed model)\n \nNA\tNA\tRT-PCR, ELISA\t[45]\n \nmBMMC\tBacterial lipopolysaccharide\t1440\tZymography\t[46]\nHMC-1\tPhorbol ester\t1440\tRT-qPCR, zymography\t\t[35] (continued on next page)\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1 (continued)\n\nMediator (Type)\tMast Cell Source\tStimulus\tTime (min)\tTechnique used\t\n\nReference\nROS (intracellular)\thuman bone marrow- derived mast cells\tAb-Ag\t0\tFlow cytometer (DCF-DA)\t[47]\n(De Novo)\t(hBMMC), rat mast cell from peritoneal lavage\t\t\t\t\n\tcavity, mBMMC\t\t\t\t\n\tmBMMC, RBL-2H3\tThapsigargin, Ab-Ag\t\t\t[30]\n\thBMMC, mBMMC\tAb-Ag\t\tFluorescence (DCF-DA)\t[48]\n\thBMMC, mBMMC\t\t\tFluorescence (DCF-DA), \ufb02ow cytometry\t[49]\n\t\t\t\t(dihydroethidium (DHE))\t\n\tRBL-2H3\t\t\tFluorescence (DCF-DA), \ufb02ow cytometry\t[50]\n\t\t\t\t(DCF-DA)\t\n\tLAD2, mBMMC\t\t\tFluorescence (DCF-DA), \ufb02ow cytometry\t[51]\n\t\t\t\t(DCF-DA, DHE)\t\n\tmBMMC, RBL-2H3\tSilver\t\tFlow cytometry (DCF-DA)\t[52]\nROS (extracellular)\tRBL-2H3\tGlycated albumin\t0\tAbsorbance (Cytochrome C reduction)\t[22]\n(De Novo)\t\t\t\t\t\n\tmBMMC, RBL-2H3\tThapsigargin, Ab-Ag\t\t\t[30]\n\tRBL-2H3\tGalectin-3\t\t\t[53]\n\tRBL-2H3\tEpigallocatechin- 3-gallate\t\t\t[29]\n\tmBMMC, RBL-2H3\tSilver\t\tChemiluminescence\t[52]\nNA = Not available/applicable.\n \n\n \n\nFig. 1. Illustration of the activity of various mass cell released enzymes. Mast cell secretes various enzymes and each exhibit speci\ufb01c catalytic activity on their substrates.

MMP-9 is synthesized upon mast cell activation and degrades gelatin and collagen.\n\n\nFig. 2. a) Substrate assisted mechanism of \u03b2-hexosaminidase. The monomers of chitin are removed successively by the hydrolysis of 1,4 glycosidic bond. The enzyme favours the carbonyl group on the acetamide of the monomer from non-reducing terminal to acts as a nucleophile, and attacks the C1 carbon of the terminal monomer. Thereafter the enzyme facilitates the attack of a water molecule at C1 causing the hydrolysis of the 1,4 glycosidic bond.

Scope of these ma- terials in therapeutic applications are huge, be it for drug delivery, presentation of occult amino acid residues for cell signaling, de- struction of cell signaling molecules, among others.

The conserved aspartic acid in the tryptase substrate-binding domain interacts with the positively charged ba- sic residue of the substrate and governs enzymatic activity. Com- binatorial peptide screenings have shown lysine and arginine at P1 renders a greater tryptase catalytic activity (Table 2) [73,74]. Argi- nine, with a longer side chain, interacts directly with the aspartic acid and the lysine interaction is bridged by a water molecule [71]. Tryptase exhibits an extended substrate speci\ufb01city, where com- binatorial experiments have shown a clear preference for as- paragine, followed by other polar or uncharged residues at P2 [71,73\u201375]. Replacing asparagine with threonine at P2 caused more than a 30% decrease in tryptase catalytic activity (Table 2, en-\n \ntry 11 vs 12, and entry 13 vs 14) [73]. However, in a study of tripeptide substrates with human pituitary tryptase it was found that peptides containing positively charged residues at both P1 and P2 have a high Kcat/KM of 107 \u2013 108 M\u22121s\u22121 (Table 2, en- try 22-24) [76]. These \ufb01ndings suggest that tryptase favors both positively charged and uncharged residues at P2, however, a neg- atively charged residue lowers the catalytic activity (Table 2, entry 19 with Kcat/KM values 10 and 33-fold higher than entry 20 and 21 respectively) [76,77]. A 100-fold decrease in catalytic activity was observed when P3 was proline [78,79]. This was also evident in the combinatorial amino acid study of the substrates [73,75]. Al- most all of the above studies have shown a clear preference for a basic charged residue lysine and arginine at P3 position (Table 2, tryptase is 100-fold more active on entry 1 and entry 6 as com- pared to entry 4 and entry 9, respectively). Finally, proline and other hydrophobic residues are preferred at P4 [73\u201375].

The two forward slashes represent the cleavage site of the substrate.\n\n \nP4 amino acid composition has little effect on catalytic activity of tryptase [74].\n2.1.4.\tSubstrate consideration for chymase\nHuman chymase activity also depends on the amino acid se- quence within the cleavage domain but, unlike tryptase, chymase substrate selectivity extends to both the C- and the N- terminal of the scissile bond [80\u201382]. Physiologically, chymase hydrolyses Angiotensin I (Ang I) to Angiotensin II (Ang II), hence Ang I has been widely used as a high a\ufb03nity substrate to study the amino acid speci\ufb01city for the enzyme [82\u201385]. Human heart chymase has shown strong P1 speci\ufb01city for a hydrophobic residue bearing an aromatic ring, particularly phenylalanine and tyrosine. A hydropho- bic residue devoid of an aromatic ring at P1 resulted in a loss of chymase activity (Table 3, entry 2 is 34-fold a better substrate that entry 5) [81\u201383,86,87]. Hydrophobic, or uncharged, residues at P2 and P3 are also preferred for increased substrate cleavage kinet- ics of chymase. Proline at P2 has been deemed crucial for catalytic activity, if other substrate parameters are not met [80\u201383,86].\nHuman chymase hydrolyses the cleavage of Ang I (Asp-Arg-Val- Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe-//-His-Leu) with 780-fold higher e\ufb03ciency than Ang II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-//-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) (Table 3, entry 10 and entry 14 respectively). The discrepancy in the catalytic activity of chymase against Ang I and Ang II, even though they have similar residue composition at the N-terminal of the scissile bond, under-\nscores the importance of C-terminal leaving groups (P1,, P2,,\u2026,Pn,)\nin substrate speci\ufb01city [83]. Peptide library studies have shown that chymase cleavage occurred for peptides with a higher fre- quency of an acidic residue at either of P1,, P2, or both, with slight preference for P2,. Similarly, serine and small hydrophobic residues were also conserved at P, [86].\n3.\tDe novo expressed mast cell enzyme\n\n3.1.\tRelease and pathophysiological signi\ufb01cance of MMP-9\n\nNeutrophils are considered as the main source of MMP-9, how- ever, activation of mast cells triggers the rapid release and long-\n \nterm expression of MMP-9 (92-kDa), which then serves as the chemoattractant for neutrophil migration [33,45]. Local concentra- tions of MMP-9 are then increased due to the accumulation and activation of neutrophils which peaks at 6-8 h after the initial in\ufb02ammatory event [89]. MMP-9 is a key in\ufb02ammatory regulator that is prevalent in diseases like neuroin\ufb02ammation, peritonitis, rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, immunological graft rejections, and wound healing [32,45,90,91]. It has been reported that 65% of mast cells from the synovial tissue of human patients with rheuma- toid arthritis had stained for MMP-9 [32]. The level of MMP-9 in the in\ufb02amed \ufb02uid of the human peritoneal cavity and in the hu- man wound \ufb02uid has been reported to be 0.3-0.4 ng/ml and 100 \u03bcg/ml respectively, which were signi\ufb01cantly higher than the basal level [45,92]. Increased level of MMP-9 has also been shown at the site of islet transplantation within 4 h of transplantation in mice, which resulted in initial in\ufb02ammatory response and improper graft function [90]. Increased MMP-9 levels at the site of in\ufb02amed tis- sue provides another enzyme for designing bioresponsive materials that affects the earliest stages of in\ufb02ammation.\n\n\n3.1.1.\tSubstrate consideration for MMP-9\nMMPs are a family of enzymes that degrades collagen. MMP-9 favors the peptide motif Pro-X-X-//-Z, where X is any amino acid, Z represents a hydrophobic residue, and // depict the cleaved bond. The amino acids at position P1, P2, and P2, separate MMP-9 from other MMPs; (i) small amino acids preferred (i.e. glycine, alanine and serine) at P1; (ii) arginine at P2; and (iii) serine and threo- nine at P2, [93\u201395]. Substrate for MMP-9, their respective kinet- ics, and speci\ufb01city for other MMPs, have been derived computa- tionally and reported [94]. Table 4 lists the peptides whose kinet- ics were determined experimentally using \ufb02uorogenic substrates and recombinant MMP-9 [95]. Further, unlike tryptase and chy- mase discussed above, peptide substrates for MMP-9 are well es- tablished and have been regularly used for biomedical applications.

Gelatins are classi- \ufb01ed as \u2018generally recognized as safe\u2019 by the FDA, and consequently, has been widely used in food, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical in- dustry. Gelatin has been studied in the context of drug delivery as it is inexpensive, easily available, biocompatible, and exhibits low immunogenicity [99,100]. Polypeptide chains (MW: 10 \u2013 100 kDa) derived from the denaturation/degradation of collagens form the gelatin, with an overall amino acid composition that varies de- pending on the collagen source and degradation processes [101]. That said, gelatin retains the general repeating unit of Gly-X-Y of collagen, where X and Y are predominantly proline and hydrox- yproline [101,102]. The two major commercial sources of gelatin has shown glycine is the most dominant type of amino acid, with 108 and 239 glycine residues per 1000 amino acids in bovine and porcine skin gelatin, respectively. Glycine was followed by proline and arginine, however, all three amino acids (glycine, proline, and arginine) were 2-3-fold higher in porcine than bovine gelatin [103]. The predominance of glycine, proline, and arginine is also the fa- vored amino acids for an MMP-9 substrate, making gelatin a nat- ural substrate for MMP-9 that can be used to design therapeutic systems to target in\ufb02ammation.\n\n4.\tProbable strategies to design therapeutics responsive to mast cell enzymes\n\nIn the preceding sections, we have highlighted enzymes that are released from mast cells upon cell activation, and which could serve as localized stimuli for in\ufb02ammatory diseases. Next, we have identi\ufb01ed substrates, or the physiochemical characteristics of amino acids which could be used to construct enzyme respective peptide substrates, for the development of bioresponsive materi- als. Starting with identi\ufb01ed enzyme substrates, we also overview general approaches previously used to develop stimuli responsive therapeutics for a variety of biomedical applications for the express purpose of drawing parallels to how these strategies may be used to target in\ufb02ammation.\n\n4.1.\tProbable strategies around COS to design \u03b2-hex responsive systems\n\nCOS are water-soluble molecules that are easy to conjugate to biological materials. Solubility, and hence hydrophobicity of COS can be easily modi\ufb01ed by varying the degree of acetylation [104\u2013106]. A \ufb01ne balance between hydrophilic COS and conju- gated hydrophobic domain facilitates self-association, which could be used to incorporate hydrophobic in\ufb02ammatory drugs in its core and trigger its release in the \u03b2-hex rich regions. COS has been used as a backbone to graft polycaprolactone (PCL) branches\n \nonto, where varying the length of the PCL branches, different nano-morphologies including spherical, rod-shaped, and vesicles, have been formed [107]. In another study, hydrophobic PCL was conjugated to COS through a disulphide bond to design a self- assembling system. The disulphide linkage rendered GSH respon- siveness for the triggered delivery of incorporated Doxorubicin (DOX) to the cancerous cells [108]. This approach provides a way to design a dual responsive system - responsive to mast cell re- leased \u03b2-hex, as well as mast cell released ROS (discussed in later section), for localizing a therapeutic at the in\ufb02ammatory site. Hydrophobic domains like that of retinoic acid and stearic acids could be used with COS to impart self-assembling characteristics, for applications including drug delivery and imaging, among other modalities [109,110]. COS has also been used to develop injectable hydrogels, where the gelation properties and degradation has been controlled by its degree of acetylation [106]. As discussed in the preceding section, skin infection causes a burst release of \u03b2-hex, and hence COS could be incorporated in the wound dressing ma- terials/gels to program its degradation, and to control the release of healing therapeutics laden in the material. In this regard, COS was used as a cross linker for electro-spun PCL \ufb01bers to impart both bioactivity and mechanical properties to the \ufb01brous mats [111].\n\u03b2-hex digestion of COS/chitosan can also be coupled with lo-\ncal tissue characteristics to ensure the localized delivery. Owed to its plentiful functional groups, both COS and chitosan, can easily be customized to possess desired ionic charges, which can help in tar- geting in\ufb02amed tissues with charged microenvironments [109,112]. Chitosan, in this regard has already been in use for designing mu- coadhesive systems, coupling this with \u03b2-hex triggered degrada- tion will open new avenues in the delivery of therapeutics to the \u03b2-hex extensive in\ufb02amed tissues [113]. This approach will also cir- cumvent the challenge posed by the ultimate diffusion of enzymes into the blood stream. For instance, the anionic mucus and the in- creased activity of \u03b2-hex in the blood serum of asthmatic patients can be synergistically used to localize and release, respectively, the therapeutics for the respiratory diseases [113,114]. In contrast, in- \ufb02ammatory bowel diseases are reported to be devoid of mucus layer consequently exposing a rather positively charged surface; which again, by using \u03b2-hex responsive COS can be used to lo- calize and deliver therapeutics in the in\ufb02amed region [115].\n\n4.2.\tProbable strategies around peptide substrates to design tryptase, chymase and MMP-9 responsive systems\n\nThe application of tryptase and chymase speci\ufb01c peptide sub- strates, to the best of our knowledge, has not been applied to any disease state. Given that these are unique to mast cells and that their relative concentrations differ throughout the in\ufb02amma- tory cascade as a function of tissue type, the use of substrates spe- ci\ufb01c to tryptase and chymase offer an untapped means of target-\n \ning active zones of in\ufb02ammation. On the contrary, peptide sub- strates for MMP-9 have been studied, but largely in the context of drug delivery to cancer. Although our scope of discussion is a more general means of targeting in\ufb02ammation for purposes be- yond drug delivery, the discussed studies utilizing peptide sub- strates may provide basic design principles that could be translated to this purpose. Polyethylene glycol (PEG)-MMP-9 peptide sub- strate (Cys-Gly-Pro-Gln-Gly-Ile-Trp-Gly-Gln-Gly-Cys-Arg) has been used to coat DOX loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN) particles to deliver drugs in MMP-9 rich cancerous tissue [97]. Similarly, MMP-9 responsive peptide (Gly-Glu-Arg-Gly-Pro-Pro-Gly- Pro-Gln-Gly-Ala-Arg-Gly-Phe-Pro-Gly-Thr-Pro-Gly-Leu) was conju- gated to PEG-poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) nanoparticles to initiate drug release upon encountering MMP-9 [98]. That said, the cleavage of another MMP-9 speci\ufb01c substrates (Pro-Leu-Gly-Val- Arg-Gly-Lys) has been used for detecting cancer through the pres- ence of MMP-9 [91].\nPeptide substrates with speci\ufb01city to other MMPs have as well been used to design enzyme responsive materials. These methods could likewise be utilized for targeting in\ufb02ammation. Our group coated cargo laden nanoparticles with peptides with varying MMP- 2 cleavage kinetics, providing a handle on how to not only use en- zymes to control the release pro\ufb01le of the loaded drug, but also the cleavage kinetics of the substrate in particular [116]. Tables 2, 3 and 4, lists peptide substrates with varying enzyme kinetics, which could be used to achieve a desired therapeutic release kinetics. Fur- ther, enzyme substrates with varying enzyme kinetics can simulta- neously be used to tailor the release suited for a given e\ufb03cacy. Enzyme cleavable domains of varying activities were incorporated in a hydrogel system to modulate the degradation of the gel, and hence, the release of incorporated drug [117,118]. Adding to these, peptide substrates of enzymes have also been used to crosslink and stabilize the hydrogel systems [119\u2013122]. The use of enzyme sensitive substrates to either cross-link or degrade 3D materials, however, obstructs the diffusion properties of the enzymes. These are important limitations which must be considered while devel- oping enzyme responsive hydrogel systems with tailored degrada- tion/drug release pro\ufb01les [120,121].\nEnzyme sensitive peptide substrates have simultaneously been\nused as a linker molecule in nano-assemblies [123,124]. PEG - Pa- clitaxel (PTX) self-assembling prodrug was synthesized using an MMP-2 peptide linker to release PTX in MMP-2 extensive tumor environment. The group later used the MMP-2 sensitive system for the co-delivery of PTX and SiRNA to cancerous cells [125,126]. Fur- ther, a triblock polylactic acid (PLA)-peptide-PLA system was devel- oped using MMP-2 sensitive peptide. The peptide cleavage resulted in a decrease in glass transition temperature which was used as a trigger for targeted cargo release at cancerous site [127]. In an- other study, curcumin, as an antitumor drug was sandwiched be- tween two PCL blocks through MMP-2 sensitive peptide for cancer treatment [128]. Cathepsin B sensitive peptide was used to conju- gate drugs like DOX and Gemcitabine to a dendrimer system for targeted drug delivery [123,129]. MMP-9 responsive peptide was conjugated to gold nanoclusters for cancer detection, with a ratio- nale that upon enzyme activity in cancerous environment, the gold nanoclusters would pass through kidney to be detected in urine [91]. These modalities highlight various ways that tryptase, chy- mase, and MMP-9 peptide substrates can be used in targeting in- \ufb02amed tissue to get favorable therapeutic results.\nIn contrast to material design strategies, where enzymatic\ncleavage has resulted in degradation or disassembly, cleavage of MMP sensitive peptides were used to decrease the hydrophilic - hydrophobic ratio which resulted in the targeted aggregation of the otherwise soluble amphiphilic system [96]. An MMP respon- sive peptide was used as a hydrophilic domain in an amphiphilic system where PTX formed the hydrophobic domain. MMP degrada-\n \ntion of the outer shell resulted in the aggregation of hydrophobic drug at the cancerous site to exert its cytotoxicity [124]. These are only a few of the various ways in which mast cell enzyme sensitive peptide substrates may be used in designing mast cell responsive materials, and that the therapeutic potential of these substrates is both unstudied and of wide applicability.\n\n4.3.\tProbable strategies around gelatin to design MMP-9 responsive systems\n\nGelatin has been extensively studied in a variety of biomaterial forms, including hydrogels, nanostructured materials, electrospun mats, and coatings [99,100]. These systems exhibit high water ab- sorptivity which can result in rapid swelling due to a large num- ber of ionizable groups [130\u2013132]. The internally charged structure of gelatin materials leads to a general electrostatic repulsion and uncontrolled burst release of encapsulated cargo; an unsuitable trait for targeted therapies [132]. However, varying the degree of crosslinking has shown to alter the release pro\ufb01le of therapeutics from the gelatin-based materials at physiological conditions [133]. Pullulan dialdehyde was used to crosslink gelatin to form a high strength hydrogel which exhibited a crosslink-dependent degrada- tion pro\ufb01le in the presence of type-1 collagenase [134]. Similarly, genipin was used as a crosslinker to prepare bone morphogenic protein 2 (BMP-2) laden gelatin microspheres as a delivery system application to bone therapy [135]. Gelatin based systems are easily amenable to strategies that utilize MMP-2 for targeting in\ufb02amed tissues.\nAnother e\ufb03cient technique, which holds promise particularly in the design of MMP-9 stimulated release systems, is the application of gelatin coatings. Gelatin was thermally adsorbed and crosslinked onto DOX loaded MSNs. This nanoparticle-gelatin system remained stable, exhibiting less than 4% drug release at physiological con- ditions [132]. To demonstrate an MMP-9 triggered release system, DOX was adsorbed onto aldehyde modi\ufb01ed MSNs, which were then sealed with crosslinked gelatin. The system, which otherwise was stable in normal physiological condition over a range of pH, the presence of MMP-9 in the in vitro condition resulted in burst re- lease of DOX [136]. Gelatin coating has also been used to ren- der stability to drug loaded lipid nanoparticles. The relative pH in- sensitivity of gelatin-based systems could be used to target a site of high MMP-9 concentrations for localized cargo delivery, as has been demonstrated by the release of BMP-2 upon the degradation of gelatin microspheres by the MMP produced by in\ufb02ammatory macrophages [135,137].\n\n5.\tLocalized ROS from mast cell activation\n\nROS as an immune regulating molecule is primarily associated with macrophages [138] and neutrophils [139], however, there are studies which have reported the release of both intra- (ROSin ) and extracellular (ROSex) ROS upon mast cell activation. ROSin is vi- tal in the downstream signaling of the cell and is pertinent to all modes of activation. Immunological activation upon the recogni- tion of antigens by the immunoglobulin E (IgE)- Fc\u025bRI complex, or by thapsigargin and ionomycin, which activate mast cells non- immunologically through calcium transport mechanism, have both shown to induce ROSin [30,47,48]. Furthermore, compounds that activate mast cells through speci\ufb01c cell receptors, with the likes of advanced glycation end products and Galectin-3, have also been shown to induce ROSin [22,53]. ROSin is rapidly released, peaking within minutes of activation [30,47]. Superoxide radicals (O2\u2212) rad- icals and hydrogen peroxides (H2O2) are the two main constituents of ROS that have been identi\ufb01ed within mast cells [49,50]. How- ever, no intracellular nitric oxide was detected in rat, mouse, or human mast cells upon antigen stimulation [47]. Fc\u025bRI mediated\n \n\n \n\nFig. 4. Generalized response of ROS sensitive molecules in the presence of ROS. Two classes of ROS sensitive molecules are being widely used. The \ufb01rst class, which includes sulphides, selenides and tellurides, respond by undergoing a hydrophobic to hydrophilic phase switch. The second class undergoes a ROS mediated cleavage, examples being diselenides and thioketals.\n\n \nmast cell activation results in both O2 \u2212 radicals and H2 O2 pro- duction, however, by two independent pathways, and have been shown to inversely effect each other\u2019s release [51].\nIn contrast to ROSin , no consensus in the literature has been arrived at regarding ROSex release. It has been argued that the evidence of ROSex is likely from the macrophage contamination\nin primary cell cultures of mast cells [140], however, others have\nshown that antigens, heavy metals like silver, and compound like epigallocatechin-3-gallate induce a rapid ROSex comprised of O2 \u2212 and H2 O2 [29,52]. The release of ROSex in response to galectin-3, though, has been associated with mast cell apoptosis [22,53]. Apart from ROSex derived exclusively from mast cells, close proximity of mast cells to macrophages, which are well documented to release ROS in their extracellular matrix, also exposes the mast cells to ROSex [138]. As discussed, ROSin and ROSex released upon mast cell activation is spatiotemporally controlled and occurs rapidly as a \ufb01rst response to cellular activation; and hence are an excellent stimulus for targeted in\ufb02ammation applications.\n\n5.1.\tSystem design strategies responsive to mast cell released ROS\n\nInitial release of ROS upon mast cell activation, which is further reinforced by other immune cells, offers an excellent stimulus to develop strategies centered around mast cells to target regions of in\ufb02ammation. Contemporary research on stimuli responsive mate- rials has seen signi\ufb01cant progress made in the design and devel- opment of ROS sensitive materials. ROS sensitive moieties within a material can be broadly classi\ufb01ed into two types: (i) ROS sensi- tive molecule that undergoes a hydrophobic to hydrophilic phase switch and includes sulphides, selenides, and tellurides; and (ii) ROS based cleavage of the molecule that includes diselenides and thioketals (Fig. 4) [141,142]. An extensive review of ROS sensi- tive molecules is beyond this review and readers are directed to other recent reviews [141,142]. Herein, a discussion on ROS sensi- tive thioketal (TK) molecule is presented due to its robust response to a variety of ROS molecules, stability across pH ranges, nontoxi- city, high reaction yields, and relative ease of functional synthesis and conjugation to biomolecules [143\u2013148].\nTK is hydrolyzed by ROS (O2 \u2212, hydroxyl radicals (OH\u2022) and\nH2O2) in the tissue environment to form a ketone and other reac- tion products (Fig. 5) [143\u2013145,147]. Because of its excellent ROS sensitivity, TKs have found varied applications in biomedical re- search ranging from chemotherapy, photodynamic therapy (PDT), to drug and therapeutic delivery [147,149,150]. TKs of varied bi- functional groups (carboxylic, amine, hydroxyl, thio and allyl) have been reported to facilitate its incorporation and conjugation into biologically relevant material systems (Fig. 5) [149,151,152]. In\ufb02am-\n \nmation, like cancer, has elevated levels of ROS, so strategies uti- lizing TK in cancer therapies could be easily translated for anti- in\ufb02ammatory responses. Incorporating TK into the repeating unit of a polymer enables fast degradation and quick release of cargo where ROS is plentiful - an approach used for chemotherapeutic drug delivery [144,150,153]. TK could also be copolymerized with a suitable anti-in\ufb02ammatory drug to form a polydrug system, as in the case with mitoxantrone (MTO)-TK system where MTO becomes active upon cleavage from TK in an ROS-rich environment [154]. Adding to these, mast cell ROSin is an excellent stimulus to bring about desired genetic manipulations. Materials, which are e\ufb03cient in condensing genetic materials, like COS, can be modi\ufb01ed with ROS sensitive entities, to enhance cellular uptake, and effective transport and release of genetic material into the cell [109,112].\n\n6.\tMast cell MRGPRX2 as in\ufb02amed tissue speci\ufb01c receptor for targeted therapies\n\nMRGPRX2 is predominantly expressed by mast cells, but has also been reported to be found on sensory neurons, and other im- mune cells (i.e. basophils and eosinophils); however, their expres- sion on unstimulated immune cells have been reported to be neg- ligible [155,156]. MRGPRX2 offers a direct route of mast cell acti- vation, in parallel with the immunoglobulin mediated Fc\u025bRI acti- vation pathway, to cause mast cell degranulation [23,34,157]. The expression pro\ufb01le of this receptor on mast cell has been shown to vary with mast cell subclass (dominant in MCTC , but not in MCT ) and anatomical sites in normal physiological conditions, as well with disease conditions [158,159]. Increased density of mast cell MRGPRX2 receptor has been shown in the lung mast cells of patients with asthma [34]; and skin mast cells of patients with atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, urticaria and prurigo [11,160,161]. Fur- thermore, MRGPRX2 has been shown to be responsible for ad- verse drug allergies as shown in the case of peptide drugs like icatibant, atracurim, antibiotics like cipro\ufb02oxacin [23,162]; and peri-operative drugs like morphine, vanomycine and cisatracurium [163].\nRecent studies have identi\ufb01ed several small molecules, antibod- ies, and peptide ligands which are speci\ufb01c to MRGPRX2 recep- tor [164\u2013166]. The presence of the \u2018distinct core structure\u2019 within the amino acid sequence that activates MRGPRX2 allows for spe- ci\ufb01c targeting of the cells [167\u2013169]. Taking this further, our group has proposed a generalized structure to design MRGPRX2 speci\ufb01c peptides with varied mast cell activating potential. An optimized core peptide structure which can activate mast cell MRGPRX2 re-\nceptor can be deduced to Xa-(Y)(n \u2265 3)-Xb where - Xa is an aro- matic residue; Xb is a hydrophobic residue; and Y is a minimum\n \n\n \n\nFig. 5.

The cleavage occurs in the presence of various types of ROS including O2\u2212, OH\u2022 and H2O2. X, Y represent the various end functional groups that have been synthesized on TK to facilitate easy chemical conjugation to biological systems and drugs.\n\nTable 5\nMRGPRX2 speci\ufb01c peptide ligands to be used as homing peptides for in\ufb02amed tissues.\n\nEntry\tPeptide Ligand\tRelative mast cell degranulation %\tModel Cell\n1\tTrp-Lys-Lys-Lys-Trp\t111\tLAD 2 Cell;\u03b2-hex releasd upon stimulationwith PAMP-12 is taken as 100 %[24]\n2\tPhe-Arg-Lys-Lys-Trp\t108\t\n3\tPhe-Arg-Lys-Lys-Trp-Asn-Lys-Trp-Ala-Leu-Ser-Arg\t100\t\n4\tTyr-Lys-Lys-Lys-Tyr\t89\t\n5\tLys-Lys-Trp-Asn-Lys-Trp-Ala-Leu-Ser-Arg\t75\t\n6\tLys-Trp-Asn-Lys-Trp-Ala-Leu-Ser-Arg\t59\t\n7\tTrp-Asn-Lys-Trp-Ala\t52\t\n8\tAsn-Lys-Trp-Ala-Leu-Ser-Arg\t8\t\n9\tPro-Cys-Lys-Asn-Phe-Phe-Trp-Lys-Thr-Phe-Ser-Ser-Cys-Lys\t100\tMRGPRX2 transfected cell;calcium released upon\n\t\t\tstimulationwith PAMP-12 and\n\t\t\tCortistatin-14is taken as 100 % [167]\n10\tSer-Glu-Phe-Arg-Lys-Lys-Trp-Asn-Lys-Trp-Ala-Leu-Ser-Arg\t53\t\n11\tAsp-Val-Ala-Ser-Glu-Phe-Arg-Lys-Lys-Trp-Asn-Lys-Trp-Ala-\t23\t\n\tLeu-Ser-Arg\t\t\n12\tAla-Arg-Leu-Asp-Val\t3\t\n13\tCyclic-Ala-Gly-Cys-Lys-Asn-Phe-Phe-Trp-(D)Lys-Thr-Phe-Thr-\t400\t\u2217 Rat peritoneal mast cell;histamine released upon\n\tSer-Cys\t\tstimulationwith Somatostatin is taken as 100 % [169]\n14\tCyclic-Ala-Gly-Cys-Lys-Asn-Phe-Phe-Trp-Lys-Thr-Phe-Thr-Ser-\t100\t\n\tCys\t\t\n15\tNon-Cyclic-Ala-Gly-Cys-Lys-Asn-Phe-Phe-Trp-Lys-Thr-Phe-\t33\t\n\tThr-Ser-Cys\t\t\n\n\u2217Rat mast cells expresses MRGPRX2 ortholog, MRGPRB3 receptor [181].\n\n \n3 residue long sequence, containing a minimum of one positively charged residue with the remainder being uncharged residues [24]. Table 5 lists several MRGPRX2 speci\ufb01c peptide with varying activ- ity towards mast cells. These peptide motifs may be utilized in multiple ways, including as homing peptides as well as a direct way to control the activity of mast cells within the extracellular milieu [170,171]. The idea of targeting a diseased tissue through peptide ligand is already in practice and has been widely used in applications like cargo delivery, detection, and imaging [172]. We herein will highlight a few of the approaches involving the use of synthetic integrin recognizing peptides, as a means of elucidating\n \npotential strategies to target in\ufb02ammation using the MRGPRX2 re- ceptor (Fig. 6).\n\n6.1.\tStrategies around mast cell MRGPRX2 peptide ligands for targeted delivery\n\nCell recognition peptides for cancerous tissues have been iden- ti\ufb01ed and are routinely used in cancer research [172]. Tissue target- ing peptides attached to the surface of iron oxide nanoparticles al- lows for magnetic resonance imaging of cancerous tissue [173,174]. DOX loaded, gold coated, silica nanoparticles were decorated with\n \n\n \n\nFig. 6. Cartoon representation of mast cell showing expression of MRGPRX2 receptor on its surface. MRGPRX2 can be used a cell speci\ufb01c receptor to speci\ufb01cally target mast cells. Several MRGPRX2 peptide substrates have been identi\ufb01ed which can be exposed onto the surface of delivery systems to localize the delivery in and around in\ufb02ammatory tissue.\n\n \nhoming peptides for the NIR triggered release of drug at the can- cerous site [175]. Similarly, receptor speci\ufb01c peptide ligands have been conjugated to polymeric nano-assemblies, liposomes and hy- drogels to facilitate targeted release of cargo [176\u2013178]. Moreover, targeting peptides have also been used in synergy with other func- tionalities [179]. For example, Arg-Gly-Asp has been used in conju- gation with the TK molecule to localize the ROS dependent release of chemotherapeutic drug to the cancerous tissue [148,154]. Fur- thermore, conjugation of cancerous cell penetrating peptides (Arg- Gly-Asp and LyP-1) to MMP-9 sensitive nano-sensors has been dis- cussed for the detection of small cancers through urine [180]. The discussed strategies can be readily applied to targeting sites of ac- tive in\ufb02ammation.\n\n7.\tLimitations and challenges\n\nTryptase and chymase share substrate speci\ufb01cities with other serine proteases [71]. Prior to using the localized presence of these enzymes to trigger a change in the biomaterial, it is imperative to evaluate the enzymatic substrate speci\ufb01city and the relative cleav- age velocities for these enzymes. The most common, and the most important enzymes, that must be considered while designing a peptide substrate for tryptase and chymase are trypsin and chy- motrypsin. Like tryptase, trypsin favors a basic residue at P1 [71], and similarly, like chymase, chymotrypsin prefers a hydrophobic amino acid with aromatic side chain [87]. It was found that enzy- matic activity of human airway trypsin (HAT) on substrates simul- taneously studied for tryptase was multifold higher. The Kcat/KM value for the enzymatic activity of HAT (Table 2, entry 20 and 21) was found to be one order of magnitude higher than that for\n \ntryptase (106 vs 105 M\u22121s\u22121, respectively) [77]. Substrate overlap of tryptase has also been shown with human plasma thrombin and coagulant factor Xa [75]. In case of chymase, substrate overlap has been shown with chymotrypsin, cathepsin G, and carboxypeptidase A [80,85,87]. A comparison of chymase activity with cathepsin G activity on thio-benzyl ester substrate (Table 3, entry 1) showed that human chymase was 7-fold higher than human cathepsin G, with respective Kcat/KM of 8.3 \u00d7 106 M\u22121s\u22121 and 1.2 \u00d7 106 M\u22121s\u22121 [87]. Likewise, substrate overlap should also be veri\ufb01ed against other MMPs when designing MMP-9 responsive biomaterials for targeting in\ufb02ammation.\nThough several enzymes may compete for a given substrate, subtle changes in the substrate structure can alter enzymatic ac- tivity. For example, C-terminal aldehyde analogues of substrates (Table 2, entry 20 and 21) have shown to reverse the enzymatic activity between HAT and tryptase [77]. The competitive activity of enzymes against given substrates can also be modulated using D- amino acids in the peptide structure [87]. Furthermore, since ser- ine enzymes have an extended substrate speci\ufb01city, careful posi- tioning of respective amino acids at a given substrate position may yield higher speci\ufb01city. For example, even though enzymes like hu- man thrombin and coagulant factor Xa favors a tryptase like ba- sic amino acid residue at P1, the most favored amino acid at posi- tion P2 was proline for thrombin and phenylalanine for coagulant factor Xa, whereas for tryptase it was asparagine [75]. This was also apparent in competitive study of chymase with carboxypepti- dase A against Ang I, where the activity of carboxypeptidase was deemed negligible in converting Ang I to Ang II [85]. Similarly, P2 arginine and P2s\u00b4erine/threonine in peptide substrates imparted MMP-9 speci\ufb01city over other MMPs. Coupled to these, signi\ufb01cant\n \nadvancement and feasibility of computational methods has made it possible for a facile screening of substrates against various en- zymes, which could be used to screen substrates prior to expensive experimentation [93].\nApart from substrate overlap, differences in the catalytic activ- ity of an enzyme from different sources could hinder the devel- opment of a versatile substrate for in\ufb02ammatory diseases: human skin tryptase was 10-fold more reactive for a given substrate than human lung tryptase (Table 2, entry 1-10). Ultimately, the decrease in the localized concentration of these enzymes with time, as they may disperse from the site of in\ufb02ammation upon entering the blood stream, poses challenge for the targeted approach [182,183].\nBlood levels of \u03b2-tryptase peaks within 15 \u2013 20 min (half-life \u223c 2\nh) for an in\ufb02ammatory response, increasing from < 1 ng/mL to >\n10 ng/mL [183]. Similarly, blood tryptase levels spike between 0.5 to 6 h at up to 2242 and 710 % respectively for anaphylactic shock and anaphylactic reactions due to drug allergy, before returning to basal levels after 24 h [184]. Although, the rate of degradation of the bioresponsive materials will be directly proportional to the concentration of the enzyme, and hence, the vast majority of bio- material will be degraded at the site of interest, the off-target re- lease of therapeutics needs to be evaluated. A similar challenge ex- ists for ROS responsive systems as well, whereby; the ubiquitously produced ROS by various cells could trigger off-target release of therapeutics. The unwanted release of therapeutics could however be reduced by the design of multi-mast cell stimuli-responsive systems. A mast cell enzyme responsive therapeutic-carrying core, with a ROS sensitive outer shell would be a great strategy in this context. ROS being short lived and localized near the in\ufb02amed tis- sue would expose the core only in the in\ufb02amed zone. This would then cause the release of therapeutic in presence on localized en- zymes, thus increasing the bioavailability of drugs to the in\ufb02amed tissue [185].\nAdding to these, tethering an MRGPRX2 peptide ligand to a\ntherapeutic delivery system can also help in localizing the drug. However, targeting active sites of in\ufb02ammation using MRGPRX2 re- ceptors poses the risk of causing partial, or complete, mast cell ac- tivation. Though mast cell activation could be bene\ufb01cial in certain cases [171], its activation could aggravate in\ufb02ammatory conditions. The use of MRGPRX2 speci\ufb01c peptides in targeting a disease would entail a tradeoff between the therapeutic e\ufb03ciency and the poten- tial for induced cell activation. It is therefore necessary to critically examine the therapeutic outcome while using MRGPRX2 speci\ufb01c peptides for cell targeting. Lastly, the binding a\ufb03nity of MRGPRX2 peptide ligands needs to be determined to e\ufb03ciently target an in- \ufb02amed tissue.\n\n8.\tConclusion\n\nTargeted therapies are bene\ufb01cial, whereby, the therapeutic e\ufb03- ciency is increased and the undesirable side effects are minimized. This approach has the potential to reduce health complications and economic burden, whilst increasing patient quality of life. Since mast cells play a crucial role in host immune response, and in the pathogenesis of several in\ufb02ammatory diseases, they provide an ex- cellent approach to design and develop therapeutics around them. Mast cell released immune mediators discerns the diseased tissue milieu from the rest of the body, and provide opportunity to tar- get a disease at the onset of its progression. In the present article, we have highlighted various ways that in\ufb02ammation could be tar- geted through utilizing unique mast cell properties. Activated mast cells triggers the rapid and local release of enzymes like \u03b2-hex, tryptase, chymase and MMP-9 in the tissue microenvironment. The enzymes discussed are both versatile (\u03b2-hex, tryptase and MMP- 9) and disease/tissue selective (chymase), which allows us to de- sign therapeutic systems for highly controlled outcomes. We have\n \nidenti\ufb01ed multiple types of substrates for these enzymes: namely peptide motifs for tryptase, chymase and MMP-9, COS for \u03b2-hex, and collagen for MMP-9. Furthermore, we have discussed strategies centered on these substrates to develop bioresponsive materials for application in therapeutic design and delivery. Challenges to the use of these enzymes for targeted approaches were also discussed, namely, overlap of substrates with other enzymes and dispersion of enzymes in the blood. In contrast to enzymes, ROS are short- lived and highly localized at in\ufb02amed tissue. Activated mast cells produce both intra- and extracellular ROS, which could be used to manipulate the immune response early in the disease pro\ufb01le. Where, extracellular ROS could be used for the localized delivery of drugs, intracellular ROS could be used to alter gene expression. We have discussed TK as a ROS responsive molecule, which is rela- tively easy to synthesize, modify and apply in biomedical research. The strategies discussed here would help in solving the chal- lenges faced with the clinically approved steroidal and nonsteroidal in\ufb02ammatory drugs, namely, the poor solubility, and the adverse side effects resulting due to the non-selectiveness of drugs [186]. The design of mast cell responsive therapeutic delivery systems will help localize the drug at the in\ufb02amed tissue, increasing the bioavailability of the drug. Furthermore, the designed systems can be used to deliver mast cell targeted therapeutics like anti- histamines, antibodies (Omalizumab, Dupilumab, Reslizumab, etc), MRGPRX2 antagonists like Shikonin, Saikosaponin, among others, to localize their delivery and increase their therapeutic e\ufb03cacy [166,187\u2013193]. Finally, we have studied the importance of MRG- PRX2 receptor on MCTC mast cell subclass as the homing peptide for in\ufb02ammatory diseases. The selective dominance of MRGPRX2 in speci\ufb01c tissue/disease offers the distinctiveness needed to resolve a diseased versus healthy tissue. Several peptide molecules speci\ufb01c to MRGPRX2 have been listed that could be used for targeted ap- plications. Targeting in\ufb02ammation through MRGPRX2 can however result in unwanted activation of mast cell, and hence their bene\ufb01t\nto risk ratio needs to be carefully evaluated.\n\nDeclaration of Competing Interest\n\nThe authors declare no con\ufb02ict of interest.\n\nAcknowledgement\n\nThis work was supported by Alberta Innovates, National Re- search Council (Canada), and Natural Science and Engineering Re- search Council (Canada).\n\nReferences\n\n[1]\tJ.S.

Abstract
At the heart of the ubiquitin–proteasome system, the 20S proteasome core particle (CP) breaks down
the majority of intracellular proteins tagged for destruction. Thereby, the CP controls many cellular pro‐
cesses including cell cycle progression and cell signalling. Inhibitors of the CP can suppress these es‐
sential biological pathways, resulting in cytotoxicity, an eﬀect that is beneficial for the treatment of cer‐
tain blood cancer patients. During the last decade, several preclinical studies demonstrated that selec‐
tive inhibition of the immunoproteasome (iCP), one of several CP variants in mammals, suppresses au‐
toimmune diseases without inducing toxic side eﬀects. These promising findings led to the identifica‐
tion of natural and synthetic iCP inhibitors with distinct chemical structures, varying potency and sub‐
unit selectivity. This review presents the most prominent iCP inhibitors with respect to possible scien‐
tific and medicinal applications, and discloses recent trends towards pan-immunoproteasome reactive
inhibitors that cumulated in phase II clinical trials of the lead compound KZR-616 for chronic inflam‐
mations.

1. Introduction
Protein homeostasis, i.e., balanced protein synthesis and degradation, is essential for cell division and a
plethora of intracellular events, among them signal transduction pathways [1,2]. In this regard, protein
breakdown has to be tightly controlled and timely regulated. In eukaryotes, proteins destined for degra‐
dation are tagged with polyubiquitin chains and targeted to the 26S proteasome, a sophisticated molecu‐
lar machine [3]. Its 19S-cap recognizes and removes the ubiquitin moieties, and, by consuming ATP,
unfolds and feeds the polypeptide chains into its proteolytic 20S core particle (CP) [4]. The latter sub‐
complex represents the key component of the ubiquitin–proteasome system and is the target of numer‐
ous drugs and natural products [5,6].
The CP is assembled of 14 α-type and 14 β-type subunits that are stacked in four seven-membered rings
around a central pore, creating a barrel [7]. In eukaryotes, the heptameric rings are built of seven dis‐
tinct α- and and seven distinct β-subunits following an α1-7β1-7β1-7α1-7 stoichiometry (Figure 1) [8]. The
α-subunits form the entry gates to the catalytic chamber [9,10] and serve as docking sites for the β-sub‐
units during proteasome assembly [11], as well as for the association with regulatory particles such as
the 19S-cap [12,13]. Three out of the seven distinct eukaryotic β-type subunits assembled in a CP,
namely β1, β2 and β5, are proteolytically active [14], and together with their adjacent subunits in the
same β-ring form channels for polypeptide binding [8]. Because the subunits diﬀer in their amino acid
composition, these substrate channels vary in their physicochemical properties and give rise to distinct
cleavage preferences. Being an endoprotease, each substrate binding channel is composed of primed
and non-primed specificity (S) pockets that bind target polypeptides in the C- to N-terminal direction (
Figure 2). The primed sites are rather shallow, maybe because they release the C-terminal cleavage
product early during the reaction cycle. In contrast, the pronounced non-primed pockets allow for tight
interactions with the N-terminal polypeptide segment and thereby largely determine cleavage specifici‐
ty [8]. Between primed and non-primed sites, the scissile peptide bond is cleaved by the active site Thr1
residue (Figure 2), which classifies the proteasome as an N-terminal nucleophile hydrolase. The Thr1
residue is embedded in and activated by two essential hydrogen bond networks [15].

built of four homo-oligomeric α- and β-rings. Being identical and harboring a catalytic Thr1 residue, all β-subunits are
proteolytically active. In contrast, eukaryotic CPs bear hetero-oligomeric α- and β-rings and only three of the seven
distinct β-subunits per ring, namely β1, β2 and β5, feature an active site. Note that one β2- and one β5-subunit are hid‐
den in the back of the particle.

pockets interacting with the amino acid side chains (P-sites) of a peptide. The proteolytically active β-subunit features

to the substrate binding channel and do not necessarily feature their own active site.

In archaea and simple eukaryotes, proteasome activity mainly serves for the production of oligopeptides
that are further decomposed into single amino acids by the action of cytosolic peptidases and ultimately
reused for de novo protein biosynthesis. In jawed vertebrates like mammals, a fraction of proteasomal
cleavage products can escape further degradation by entering the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). After Nterminal trimming by ER-residing peptidases, the fragments associate with major histocompatibility
class I (MHC-I) receptors [16]. The resulting complexes are transported to the cell surface and present‐
ed to patrolling immune cells [17]. If the immune system detects peptides of foreign, i.e., viral or bacte‐
rial, origin on a body cell, the immune defense will be activated and the antigen-presenting cell will be
killed to prevent the spreading of the infectious agent [18,19]. This process demands for the eﬃcient
production and presentation of proteasomal cleavage products and for reliable discrimination of selfand non-self peptides by immune cells. To this end, mammals evolved specialized CP types that shape
the adaptive immune system and take over tissue-specific functions in protein degradation [20,21,22].
Among the four mammalian CP types, the constitutive proteasome core particle (cCP) is the most abun‐
dant, as it is present in all body cells and performs the bulk of intracellular protein degradation. Its sub‐
unit composition and cleavage specificities are closely related to the proteasome of unicellular eukary‐
otes and it comprises the active entities β1c, β2c and β5c [23,24,25,26]. The second best characterized
CP is the immunoproteasome. Although expression of the immunoproteasome core particle (iCP) can
be induced in all body cells by the action of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interferon-γ (IFNγ) and
tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), only immune cells constantly produce iCPs [20]. The iCP eﬃciently

generates oligopeptides with hydrophobic C-terminal anchor residues and a high aﬃnity for the MHC-I
receptor [27,28], thereby supporting antigen presentation as well as pathogen clearance. This physio‐
logical function of the iCP is based on its altered substrate cleavage preferences emanating from the
subunits β1i, β2i and β5i [29,30,31].
Only in recent years two additional CP types have been discovered; first, the thymoproteasome core
particle (tCP), exclusively present in cortical epithelial cells of the thymus, drives maturation and posi‐
tive selection of T cells by producing low aﬃnity peptides for MHC-I receptors [32,33]. This process is
crucial for establishing self-tolerance as well as preventing autoimmunity [34] and relies on the unique
subunit composition of the tCP (β1i, β2i and β5t) [32]. The latest discovery of CPs was the spermato‐
proteasome (sCP), which is required for proper spermatogenesis in mammalian testes and incorporates
a variant of subunit α4, thereby altering the interaction with regulatory particles [35,36,37]. Apart from
these main CP types, a number of mixed particles have been described as well [38,39,40], however
their physiological relevance remains to be investigated in more detail.
In the mid-90s of the last century, scientists started to explore CP inhibition [41]. At that time, it was
unknown whether the crucial function of the CP for cell survival would leave a therapeutic window of
application for CP inhibitors or not. To date, 30 years later, proteasome inhibition represents an incredi‐
ble success story that has led to a plenitude of proteasome ligands, both from synthetic and natural
sources, including three clinically applied inhibitors (for up-to-date reviews on proteasome inhibition
see for example: [6,42,43]). Bortezomib (Velcade®), carfilzomib (Kyprolis®) and ixazomib (Ninlaro®)
significantly improved the clinical outcome of multiple myeloma patients by non-selectively targeting
CPs and killing cancer cells that strictly rely on high-capacity protein degradation [44,45]. The constant
production of antibodies and the accumulation of misfolded immunoglobins sensitize multiple myelo‐
ma cells for proteasome inhibition and apoptosis [46]. However, the side eﬀects associated with protea‐
some inhibition, as well as the high reactivity and cytotoxity of clinically applied compounds, limited
additional as well as long-term therapeutic applications in non-malignant diseases so far [47,48]. Dur‐
ing the last decade, with increasing knowledge about the iCP, selective inhibition of CP subtypes and
single subunits was explored. Initial preclinical studies reported impressive results, suggesting that se‐
lective inhibition of the iCP could be beneficial for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, for which
only few modestly eﬀective therapeutic options are currently available. The intimate connection be‐
tween the iCP and pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases or certain cancers opened up a new field of
proteasome research and this review intends to cover the developments in this vivid area of academic
and pharmaceutical research.

2. Principles of Proteasome Inhibition
2.1. Covalent Versus Non-Covalent Inhibitors

2/19/24, 10:57 AM

Inhibitors can be grouped into non-covalently and covalently acting ones depending on their type of
interaction with the target protein. The former group acts per se reversibly, while covalent inhibitors can
form permanent (irreversible) or transient (reversible) linkages with proteins. In general, non-covalent
inhibitors are expected to cause less unwanted side eﬀects and to have fewer oﬀ-targets. Moreover, they
are rumored to be less toxic and target single subunits more selectively than their covalent counterparts,
the selectivity of which may be obscured by oﬀ-target modifications after long-term exposure. Al‐
though non-covalently acting CP inhibitors have been investigated in detail (reviewed for example in
[49,50]), none of them have been investigated in clinical trials so far. Most importantly, the high sub‐
strate turnover of CPs and the accumulation of substrates upon CP inhibition may interfere with tight
and sustainable blockage, thus leading to early displacement of inhibitors from the active sites without
inducing significant and therapeutically relevant eﬀects [51]. Despite their high and often indiscrimi‐
nate reactivity associated with oﬀ-target activities, covalent inhibitors are currently experiencing a re‐
vival in drug development [52] and appear to be the compounds of choice for CP inhibitors with clini‐
cal applications. Their advantages are high potency, lower eﬀective doses, long-lasting eﬀects by low
dissociation rates or irreversible inhibition, favorable pharmacodynamic profiles (that endure detectable
drug levels in body fluids), and less sensitivity to pharmacokinetics (e.g., resorption and metabolism)
[53]. Although there are exceptions (see Section 4.1.1, Section 4.3.1 and Section 5.1), most proteasome
inhibitors share a peptidic scaﬀold with a C-terminal electrophilic warhead that covalently targets the
catalytic Thr1 residue (see also Section 2.2). Among the class of non-covalent CP inhibitors, non-pep‐
tidic ones are also known, which oﬀer superiority in terms of metabolic stability and bioavailability. Of
note, most natural and synthetic CP ligands target the non-primed substrate binding pockets that are
more pronounced compared to their primed counterparts. In the following sections, inhibitors with all
kinds of structures, functional groups and iCP subunit profiles will be presented and discussed in the
context of their therapeutic potential.

2.2. Important Reactive Warheads
Various electrophilic head groups can covalently target the CP, including aldehydes, vinyl sulfones,
vinyl amides, β-lactones, boronic acids and α, β-epoxyketones, among others. Their reaction mecha‐
nisms, as well as pros and cons, are discussed in detail elsewhere, for example in [5,49,54]. Here, only
boronic acids and α, β-epoxyketones are introduced, as these are the electrophiles most frequently used
for iCP inhibitor development.
Boronates are a group of highly reactive, slowly reversible CP inhibitors. In this regard, a number of
oﬀ-targets have been reported for bortezomib, the prototype boronic acid CP inhibitor and frontline
treatment for multiple myeloma patients. In particular, co-inhibition of neuronal serine proteases by
bortezomib has been correlated with severe neurodegeneration and neurotoxicity [55]. Although this
oﬀ-target activity can be reduced as exemplified with ixazomib [56], oxidative deboronation and subse‐
quent reaction with, for example, glutathione, might also cause unwanted eﬀects [57,58].

2/19/24, 10:57 AM

With the discovery of the natural product epoxomicin and its electrophilic epoxyketone warhead, an
alternative to aldehydes and boronic acids became available [59]. Modifying both the Thr1 hydroxyl
group and its free N-terminus [60], the epoxyketone irreversibly inhibits proteasome activity without
touching other intracellular serine or cysteine proteases [55]. This improvement in selectivity led to the
approval of the second-generation CP inhibitor carfilzomib (Kyprolis®) for clinical use [61]. The
epoxyketone warhead was also selected for the development of various peptide-based iCP selective in‐
hibitors (see Section 4.3.2, Section 5.4, Section 5.5 and Section 5.6).

3. Inhibition of the Immunoproteasome—A Short Historic Outline
Along with the growing clinical success of the broad-spectrum proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (Vel‐
cade®) in the early 2000s [62] and the discovery of CP subtypes, the interest in selective CP inhibition
rose. In 2009, the report of the iCP ligand ONX 0914 (formerly PR-957) and evidence for its therapeu‐
tic activity in mouse models of autoimmune disorders caused sensation [63]. The study provided the
proof-of-concept for selective iCP inhibition and opened up new fields of application—in particular for
diseases that are characterized by elevated iCP levels, such as chronic inflammatory syndromes, certain
types of cancers and neurodegenerative diseases. Inspired by the hope for lower eﬀective doses, less
side eﬀects and better safety profiles compared to conventional non-selective CP inhibitors, the devel‐
opment of and screening for subtype-selective CP ligands by academic groups and pharmaceutical
companies soon picked up speed. In parallel, structural studies on the iCP were conducted to facilitate
and support drug design [26,64,65,66]. This combined eﬀort over the last decade led to the identifica‐
tion of numerous inhibitors for all active sites of cCP and iCP. Besides serving as excellent research
tools to monitor proteasome activities [67] and to assess the contribution of single CP subunits to anti‐
gen processing, presentation [68] and cytokine production, these compounds allowed further explo‐
ration of the role of the iCP in disease progression and potential therapeutic applications [47]. Their
respective chemical structures, their development, as well as their biological activities are thoroughly
discussed in Section 4. However, as the therapeutic benefit of single-subunit-selective inhibition in pre‐
clinical models of autoimmune diseases turned out to be low, co-inhibition of at least two iCP subunits
was aspired. In this regard, ONX 0914, initially considered as β5i-selective, has recently been re-classi‐
fied as a pan-iCP inhibitor that targets both β5i- and β1i-subunits [69]. Section 5 will account for the
current developments in the field of pan-immunoproteasome inhibition and highlight promising com‐
pounds that might find clinical applications in the future.

4. Subunit-Selective Inhibitors of the Immunoproteasome
4.1. Inhibitors of Subunit β1i

Already in the 1990s it was noted that iCP and cCP diﬀer in their substrate cleavage preferences. For
iCPs, cleavages after acidic residues (caspase-like activity) were found to be reduced, whereas hydroly‐
sis after hydrophobic (chymotrypsin-like (ChT-L) activity) and basic (trypsin-like activity) residues was
enhanced [29,70]. This notion correlated with structure-based comparison of β1c- and β1i-sequences
[8], indicating that key polar residues in the substrate binding channel of subunit β1c in cCPs are re‐
placed by hydrophobic ones in β1i of iCPs. These findings allowed for the development of β1i-selective
inhibitors long before structural data visualized the β1i-substrate binding channel for the first time [26].
4.1.1. Non-Covalent Inhibitors The only known non-covalent inhibitor with pronounced β1i-selectivity
has been reported by Ettari et al.; amide compound 7 has a Ki value of 0.021 µM for β1i and retains a
residual activity for other cCP and iCP subunits of > 17% at 50 µM (Table 1; Figure 3) [71]. Molecular
docking indicates smooth fitting to the β1i/β2i-substrate binding channel similar to ONX 0914 [71],
thus qualifying the compound as a suitable building block for future fragment-based drug design strate‐
gies.

cording to their subunit selectivity and arranged according to their discussion in the text. The original compound num‐
bering from patents or publications was taken over wherever possible (for references see Table 1). To avoid duplicates,
compounds 1a and 1b were given a letter in addition. For inhibition values see Table 1. Due to space limitations, only
selected compounds of each class are depicted.

Table 1
Overview of iCP selective inhibitors and their potency. Due to space limitations, only key compounds of each class are
presented. IC50 values (given in [µM]) depend on the chosen setting (purified CP/cell lysate/in cells), enzyme concen‐
tration and time of incubation, and thus are hardly comparable. As a measure of subunit selectivity, ratios of IC50 val‐
ues are given. The ratio positively correlates with selectivity for the respective i-subunit. ‘n.r.’ designates values that
have not been reported. Colors reflect the distinct selectivity patterns of inhibitors: green for β1i-, brown for β2i-, yel‐
low for β5i- and gray for pan-reactive inhibitors. Inhibition values are light-colored, while selectivity ratios are darkshaded. Most pan-reactive inhibitors target β1i and β5i (green and yellow shades, respectively). Only LU-005i moder‐
ately inhibits all immunoproteasome subunits (green, brown and yellow shades).

4.1.2. Covalent Inhibitors In 2007, Millenium Pharmaceuticals Inc. filed a patent on peptide boronic
acid inhibitors, among them a fluorinated β1i-selective derivative of bortezomib, termed ML604440 (
Figure 3) [92]. Later, this dipeptide boronate was used to study diﬀerential antigen processing by the

subunits β1c and β1i [72] and to evaluate therapeutic eﬀects on immune thrombocytopenia, an autoim‐
mune bleeding disorder. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients suﬀering from immune throm‐
bocytopenia showed increased expression of β1i, but treatment with ML604440 failed to normalize the
number of platelets in mice with immune thrombocytopenia [93]. In contrast, ONX 0914 was able to
revert platelet counts in this mouse model, suggesting that selective inhibition of β1i may not be suﬃ‐
cient to reach therapeutic eﬃcacy [93].
In 2009, UK-101, a structural derivative of dihydroeponemycin, was reported to be a β1i-selective in‐
hibitor [74]. Its aliphatic n-heptanoic tail is directed to the interface of β1i- and β2i-subunits and the
tert-butyldimethylsilyl group hinders modification of β5-subunits (Figure 3) [94,95]. UK-101 targets
subunit β1i in Raji cell lysates with an IC50 value of 0.104 µM, and shows 144-fold selectivity over β1c
(Table 1), and 10- and 30-fold selectivity over β5c as well as β5i, respectively. This modest subunit se‐
lectivity profile resembles that of the parent molecule dihydroeponemycin [94,96]. UK-101 has been
shown to inhibit proliferation of prostate cancer cells [74,97] and tumor growth in a xenograft mouse
model of prostate cancer [97], but this eﬀect may result from partial co-inhibition of β5i- and β5c-ac‐
tive sites at the applied concentrations [73,75]. In agreement, oﬀ-target activities towards other protea‐
some subunits have been observed over time and these may result from cleavage of the ether bond by an
intracellular hydrolase and loss of the tert-butyldimethylsilyl group, resulting in progressive co-inhibi‐
tion of β5-active sites [98].
Based on NC-001, a potent β1-inhibitor [99], the Overkleeft group developed a β1i-selective epoxyke‐
tone. The tetrapeptide LU-001i features a fluorinated L-Pro analogue at P3 (Figure 3) and has similar
potency to UK-101 but higher subunit selectivity. IC50 values were determined in Raji cell lysates as
0.095 µM for β1i and 24 µM for β1c (252-fold selectivity for β1i over β1c), and ≥20 µM for all other
proteasome subunits (Table 1) [73]. Being active in cells, the therapeutic potential of LU-001i was eval‐
uated in vitro and in vivo. These studies revealed that LU-001i alone is unable to block diﬀerentiation
of T helper cells or lower MHC-I surface and cytokine expression [91]. Most importantly however, it
lacks the potential to ameliorate symptoms of dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis in mice [91].
Recently, another epoxyketone, dubbed DB-310, has been reported to be a potent and selective β1i-in‐
hibitor (Figure 3). It is claimed to have improved selectivity and permeability in cells that overexpress
the eﬄux transporter ABCB1—a requirement for brain barrier penetration. With its moderate β1i-selec‐
tivity (~8-fold), DB-310 suppresses proinflammatory cytokines and leads to cognitive improvements in
a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease [75].
The most potent and selective β1i-inhibitor known to date, KZR-504, has been described by Kezar Life
Sciences Inc. (Figure 3). IC50 values were determined in MOLT-4 (human T cell leukemia) cell lysates
as 0.051 µM for β1i and 46.35 µM for β1c (908-fold selectivity for β1i over β1c; Table 1) [76]. Al‐
though KZR-504 has been improved with respect to solubility and stability, it failed to suppress the pro‐
duction of pro-inflammatory cytokines in in vitro cell culture assays [76], similar to LU-001i [91].

Given the shallow S2-pockets of proteasome substrate binding channels [26], the presented β1i-selec‐
tive ligands are diverse in their P2-sites but share some structural features at their P1- and P3-sites.
First, Leu (UK-101, DB-310 and ML604440), cyclohexyl (LU-001i) and Phe (KZR-504) moieties are
reasonable P1-sites to target β1i. Second, most β1i-selective compounds share a cyclic residue at P3—a
structural feature that is also known from the peptide substrate Ac-PAL-AMC, used to selectively mon‐
itor β1i-activity by fluorescence spectroscopy [100]. Like Ac-PAL-AMC, LU-001i and DB-310 carry a
P3-L-Pro residue, while KZR-504 and ML604440 feature a 2-pyridone or a 2-trifluoromethylbenzoyl
moiety, respectively. Although cyclic residues appeared to drive β1-selectivity in general [73,76], the
reason for this observation was initially unclear. In 2015, a structural study showed that compounds
with Pro at P3 are tilted in β2/β3- and β5/β6-substrate binding channels compared with their Leu ana‐
logues. However, no such eﬀect has been observed at the β1/β2-active sites. Particularly, Asp114 of β3
and β6 as part of the β2/β3- and β5/β6-substrate binding channels displaces P3-Pro ligands and leads to
their pronounced β1-selectivity [101]. Similar findings were recently reported by Johnson et al., who
showed by molecular modelling that the 2-pyridone moiety of KZR-504 fails to interact with Asp114 of
β3- and β6-subunits [76].

4.2. Covalent Inhibitors of Subunit β2i
Historically, subunit β2c of cCPs has been assigned trypsin-like activity, but in fact it is rather pro‐
miscuous, because its S1-pocket, the major determinant of substrate specificity, is lined with Gly45 and
thus is rather spacious [8]. Subunit β2i of iCPs is highly similar to its constitutive counterpart β2c in
terms of structure and activity [26], raising questions about the biological function and benefit of β2i
versus β2c. Additionally, the structural similarity precludes development of subunit-selective fluoro‐
genic substrates [100] and inhibitors.
Nonetheless, after huge screening eﬀorts, some progress in this field was recently reported. Synthesis
and evaluation of a library of ONX 0914 derivatives identified the β2i-selective compound LU-002i (
Figure 3) [77]. ONX 0914 served as a blueprint, as it slightly discriminates between β2i and β2c (~1.8
fold preference for β2i) according to its subunit selectivity profile [73]. By installing large P1-sites on
the otherwise unchanged ONX 0914 scaﬀold, LU-002i with pronounced β2i-selectivity and potency
was obtained (IC50 values determined in Raji cell lysates: 0.18 µM for β2i; 12.1 µM for β2c; β2c/β2i
ratio: 67; Table 1). To visualize the structural basis for this selectivity of LU-002i, yeast proteasomes
having incorporated large parts of human β2c- or β2i-subunits were designed and produced [77]. Com‐
plex structures with a derivative of LU-002i revealed that the β2i-active site can adapt more easily to
bulky P1-residues, whereas the corresponding site in β2c seems to be rather rigid. In particular, the hy‐
drogen bond interaction between Asp53 and His35 in β2c might oppose the binding of inhibitors staﬀed
with large P1-sites, while Glu53 of β2i might allow for more flexibility and leave a narrow window to
establish selectivity [77]. As an add-on, LU-002i has been functionalized at the P2-site to create an ac‐
tivity-based probe (ABP) for the visualization of β2i-activity of human iCPs. Although LU-002i and its

2/19/24, 10:57 AM

ABP derivative are functional in cell lysates, it is unknown whether they can penetrate cell membranes
and are eﬀective in vivo. To the best of our knowledge, LU-002i is the only β2i-selective ligand known
to date and it has not yet been tested for any biologically or therapeutically relevant in vivo eﬀects.

4.3. Inhibitors of Subunit β5i
The ChT-L activities of β5-subunits are by far the most important cleavage specificities of CPs and thus
they are the target of most synthetic and natural proteasome inhibitors. As with β2-subunits, the β5cand β5i-substrate binding channels only marginally diﬀer in sequence and structure. The most pro‐
nounced distinction is the size of their S1-specificity pockets, originating from a conformational change
of Met45. While in subunit β5c Met45 flexibly arranges with various kinds of apolar amino acid side
chains, preferentially leucine, the S1-pocket of β5i is enlarged and promotes cleavage after bulky hy‐
drophobic residues such as Phe, Tyr or Trp [26]. Thus, by staﬃng inhibitors with large P1-residues,
β5i-selectivity can be gained.
Given the huge number and the structural heterogeneity of β5i-selective drugs published over the last
years, their presentation and discussion is grouped according to mode of inhibition and structural fea‐
tures.
4.3.1. Non-Covalent Inhibitors In the hope for higher isoform selectivity compared to covalently acting
compounds, several non-covalent and often non-peptidic iCP inhibitors with exquisite potency and β5iselectivity have been identified over the last few years. While some already underwent several optimiza‐
tion steps, the smaller ones especially might serve as potent fragments for future extensions and modifi‐
cations.
Isolated Fragments In a computational docking approach with ~300,000 compounds, a β5i-selective
non-peptide fragment (compound 1; Figure 3) was discovered. Using purified human iCP, the IC50 val‐
ue for β5i was determined as 1.7 µM. At 5 µM, β5c showed 80% residual activity, indicating that the
compound preferentially targets β5i over β5c (Table 1) [78]. However, other proteasome activities have
not been tested for co-inhibition, thus leaving questions about the selectivity. Further evaluation, e.g.,
by structural studies, is necessary to confirm the inhibition and to make use of the findings in rational
drug design eﬀorts.
Psoralenes Another virtual screening identified psoralenes as potential iCP inhibitors. The nonpeptidic
compound 3 (Figure 3) targets β5i with 107-fold selectivity over β5c (Ki values of 1.6 µM for β5i and
172.2 µM for β5c; Table 1) [79]. It penetrates cell membranes and inhibits the iCP in cells with similar
selectivity as ONX 0914 but 1000-fold lower potency. To enhance target aﬃnity, compound 3 was
functionalized with diﬀerent electrophilic warheads [79] and further modifications were introduced to

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8394499/

2/19/24, 10:57 AM

stimulate selectivity [102]. To make use of the psoralene scaﬀold in future fragment evolution or link‐
ing approaches, structural analysis of the binding mode of compound 3 or one of its derivatives to the
CP might be useful.
N,C-Capped Dipeptides In recent years, several non-covalently acting N,C-capped dipeptide and
dipeptidomimetic inhibitors with β5i-selectivity have been reported [100,103]. Among them, the N,Ccapped dipeptide DPLG3 (Figure 3). It targets subunit β5i with an IC50 value of 0.0045 µM and 7200fold selectivity over β5c, while other activities are inhibited <50% at 33.3 µM (Table 1) [80]. DPLG3
suppresses cytokine release in vitro and shows eﬃcacy in an animal heart transplantation model by sig‐
nificantly extending the graft survival time [80]. Although DPLG3 should not target subunits other than
β5i at the applied concentrations, in vivo inhibition values have not been reported and so it remains to
be further investigated whether single-subunit inhibition is really suﬃcient for the observed therapeutic
eﬀects [47]. Due to its adverse physicochemical properties, i.e., high hydrophobicity and poor water
solubility, as well as poor cell penetration ability, eﬀorts to improve DPLG3 were undertaken and af‐
forded several derivatives, among them PKS21272 with 500-fold β5i-selectivity and IC50 values of
0.0012 µM for β5i and 0.61 µM for β5c, as well as < 50% inhibition of other subunits at 33.3 µM [104].
This compound is cell-penetrating and inhibits proteasomes in vivo but at lower selectivity (81-fold
selectivity for iCP) and potency (0.053 µM). In addition, PKS21272 can inhibit activation and prolifera‐
tion of T cells [104]. Notably, derivatives of DPLG3 are claimed to be ‘active site-directed non-compet‐
itive inhibitors’ [64,104], meaning that their inhibition potency is not aﬀected by accumulating sub‐
strate concentrations. Considering their peptidic or peptide-like structure and their binding to the natur‐
al β5-substrate binding pockets [64], a non-competitive mode of action is questionable.
Thiazole Compounds In 2014, Roche Diagnostics patented a set of non-peptidic compounds with pro‐
nounced β5i-selectivity and -potency [81]. This set of inhibitors is based on a thiazole core that features
an aromatic bicyclic moiety at the C2-site linked to a carboxylic acid via a peptide bond. To resolve the
binding mode of the ligands to the proteasomal active site and their basis for selectivity, the most potent
(IC50 value of 0.025 µM for human β5i) and selective (800-fold over β5i) compound of this series [81],
termed Ro19 (Figure 3), was studied by X-ray crystallography with a humanized yeast proteasome, fea‐
turing the human β5i/β6-substrate binding channel [105]. The X-ray data visualized that Ro19 occupies
the S1-pocket and also S1/S3-sub-sites that are not accessible to natural peptide-based ligands but vari‐
ous synthetic compounds [106,107]. Ro19 and all other compounds of this class are β5i-selective, as
their bulky quinolone moiety complies better with the spacious S1-pocket of β5i than with the smaller
one of β5c. In addition, binding to the active sites of β1i and β2i is precluded by steric hindrance of the
thiazole ring with residues of their S3-pockets. Notably, Ro19 is a poor inhibitor of mouse β5i—proba‐
bly because the mouse specific residue Met31 hinders its placing [105]. Proteasomal substrate binding
channels are well conserved in sequence and structure among diﬀerent species, but sub-pockets outside
the natural ligand binding sites may not be. Thus, inhibitors with oversized P1-sites or non-standard

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8394499/

Page 13 of 34

A Nut for Every Bolt: Subunit-Selective Inhibitors of the Immunoproteasome and Their Therapeutic Potential - PMC

2/19/24, 10:57 AM

binding modes like Ro19 may be associated with significant species-selectivity and demand for careful
selection of animal models for preclinical studies. Similar observations were made with the covalent
β5i-inhibitors PR-924 [106] and M3258 [66] (see Section 4.3.2.)
4.3.2. Covalent Inhibitors The majority of β5i-inhibitors feature a reactive functional group that either
reversibly or irreversibly links them to the nucleophilic Thr1 residue (see Section 2.2). However, this
covalent mode of action usually gives rise to co-inhibition of unwanted activities and often dampens
subunit selectivity, because all proteolytically active β-subunits of the CP share the same active site ar‐
chitecture and catalytic mechanism [8,15,26]. Alternative approaches therefore explore non-catalytic
amino acids nearby the active site as nucleophiles.
Inhibitors targeting Cys48 of β5i The concept of targeting non-catalytic residues has been successfully
applied to a wide range of enzymes, including the proteasome [108,109]. More recently, it has also
been exploited for the development of β5i-selective inhibitors. Three independent studies selected
Cys48 at the interface of the S2- and S4-specificity pockets as a nucleophilic target residue [82,83,110].
Because β5c encodes a non-reactive Gly at this position [26], the strategies aimed for a strong covalent
blockage of β5i and either no or a modest non-covalent inhibition of β5c. The concept of gaining sub‐
unit preferences by reactivity rather than non-covalent interactions is a smart approach pursued by sev‐
eral pharmaceutical companies.
Already, in 2015, Principia Biopharma Inc. filed a patent describing inhibitors that form a reversible
covalent bond with the conserved non-catalytic Cys48 of β5i [110]. The prototype compound PRN1126
(Figure 3) was shown to be ~30-fold selective for human β5i over human β5c (IC50 values determined
for purified human cCP and iCP: 0.0072 µM for β5i and 0.21 µM for β5c) without touching other pro‐
teasome activities (Table 1) [69]. Although being truly β5i-selective, PRN1126 dampened neither
MHC-I surface expression nor interleukin (IL)-6 secretion, nor Th17 diﬀerentiation. In addition, no
therapeutic benefit was noted in experimental models of autoimmune diseases [69], questioning the
hitherto existing dogma that selective inhibition of β5i translates into therapeutic potential. Notably,
experimental proof for the proposed reaction mechanism of PRN1126 with Cys48 is still not available,
but the nitrile functional group of PRN1126 (Figure 3) is supposed to approach Cys48 via the S2-pock‐
et. Subsequent nucleophilic attack of the C-N triple bond by the thiol likely results in a reversible cova‐
lent thioimidate linkage [111].
Furthermore, a patent application of Merck KGaA from 2016 reports a group of β5i-selective com‐
pounds with IC50 values <0.050 µM and ≥150-fold selectivity for β5i over β5c [82]. The compounds
bear a boronic acid head group that targets Thr1, and a second electrophile—frequently an acrylamide
moiety (such as in compound 16, Table 1, Figure 3)—that may function as a Michael acceptor in the
reaction with Cys48 of subunit β5i. Given their dipeptide structure, these boronic acid inhibitors are
expected to target Cys48 like PRN1126 via the S2-pocket, but experimental proof for this reaction
mechanism is not available.

2/19/24, 10:57 AM

In another study, Dubiella et al. designed a decarboxylated peptide that is derived from carfilzomib
(Kyprolis®) and directed to Cys48 via an electrophile at its P4-site [83]. Among the tested nucle‐
ophiles, the α-chloroacetamide variant 1-CA was the most potent. Variant 1-CA showed nine-fold se‐
lectivity for β5i over β5c, and did not target other subunits of human cCP or iCP [83]. Using a mutant
yeast proteasome, the covalent reaction of the α-chloroacetamide at P4 with Cys48 at the active site of
β5 was visualized and confirmed. Notably, yeast β1- and β2-subunits also encode potential nucleophiles
in their substrate binding channel, but in agreement with activity assays neither Ser48 of β1 nor
Thr48/Cys31 of β2, nor Cys114 of β3 reacted with 1-CA [83]. This notion is also in agreement with the
subunit selectivity of PRN1126 [69]. Improvements of the peptide moiety of 1-CA finally led to 4-CA (
Figure 3). Featuring a Asn residue at P3 that can hydrogen bond to Ser27 of β5i but not to Ala27 of
β5c, 4-CA showed improved β5i-potency (IC50 0.64 µM) and -selectivity (156-fold over β5c; Table 1)
[83].
Inhibitors Targeting Thr1
Oxathiazolones
Oxathiazolones are assumed to irreversibly modify the proteasomal active site. Multiple compounds of
this class have been investigated for their β5i-selectivity, with HT2004 performing the best with puri‐
fied human CPs (kinact/Ki for β5i: 1093; selectivity for β5i over β5c: 4752; Table 1, Figure 3) [48]. Al‐
though oxathiazolones are able to penetrate cell membranes, their instability in water prevented further
biological studies [48]. The oxathiazolone head group has also been installed on non-covalent psoralene
fragments, ultimately resulting in a potent and selective inhibitor (IC50 for purified human CPs: 0.106
µM for β5i; residual activity of other active sites is ≥ 67% at 10 µM) [79,102]. Despite significant im‐
provements, poor cell penetration prevented further investigations [102].
Piperlongumine
Piperlongumine is a pepper alkaloid that features a vinylamide group similar to CP inhibitors of the
syrbactin class (Figure 3). By structural analogy, piperlongumine was proposed to irreversibly modify
the active site Thr1 of proteasome subunits in a Michael-type 1,4-addition [84,112]. In enzyme assays
with human cCP and iCP, piperlongumine was found to block β5i with an IC50 value of 15 µM, while
β5c and β1c were inhibited <30% at 50 µM (Table 1). However, other catalytic sites of the proteasome
were not tested for potential co-inhibition. The cytotoxic eﬀects of piperlongumine have been linked to
various molecular mechanisms, including oxidative stress, DNA damage and apoptosis [113], suggest‐
ing that iCP inhibition might only in part contribute to this biological activity [84].
Boronates

2/19/24, 10:57 AM

In the search for boronic acids that are not bioactivated by oxidative deboronation [58] and carry a nonpeptidic scaﬀold, a virtual compound library was screened by molecular docking. Hits that were pre‐
dicted to adopt a Ro19-like binding mode [105] were prioritized. Among the identified compounds, 1a (
Figure 3; originally published as 1) is ranked the highest, as it shows modest aﬃnity for β5i (IC50 value
for purified human iCP: 34 µM) and moderate selectivity over β5c (three-fold; Table 1) [85]. However,
a complete cCP and iCP subunit selectivity profile has not been determined. Considering the high reac‐
tivity of boronic acid compounds in general and the low potency of 1a, the potential of this agent as a
CP ligand is considered rather low, but the scaﬀold might inspire future fragment-based inhibitor de‐
sign strategies.
In a joint venture, Genentech Inc. and Proteros Biostructures GmbH determined the X-ray structure of
the human iCP in complex with a β1i- and β5i-selective boronic acid [65] (see also Section 5.3), patent‐
ed by Roche [90]. Based on these structural data, the highly β5i-selective compound 22 (IC50 value for
purified iCP: 0.0041 µM for β5i; 2219-fold selective over β5c; Table 1, Figure 3) was designed. Yet, β2inhibition values have not been reported. The inhibitor did not induce cell death in immune cells, but
was not tested for its potential to lower proinflammatory cytokines [65].
Besides, peptidic boronates with β5i-selectivity have been reported by Merck KGaA. In addition to the
bifunctional ones discussed above [82], the company developed M3258 (Figure 3), an orally-available
β5i-selective inhibitor with 614-fold selectivity over β5c and all other catalytic sites of cCP and iCP
(IC50 value for purified iCP: 0.0041 µM) and favorable pharmacokinetic properties [66,114]. M3258
carries a bulky 3-benzofuranyl moiety that, together with the single amide group, dictates β5i-selectivi‐
ty [115]. M3258 has strong anti-tumor activity in several multiple myeloma models, including those
refractory to bortezomib, and reduces various cytokines, including IL-6 and TNFα levels [66]. Remark‐
ably, the agent has fewer side eﬀects compared with its structural analogues bortezomib (Velcade®) and
ixazomib (Ninlaro®) that target both β5c- and β5i-subunits [66,116]. It is currently under evaluation in
a phase I study as a single agent or combination therapy with dexamethasone for the treatment of pa‐
tients with relapsed refractory multiple myeloma (NCT04075721) [66].
Peptide epoxyketone inhibitors
In 2009, scientists of Proteolix Inc. published the β5i-selective compound PR-924 [86]. PR-924, a
tripeptide epoxyketone inhibitor carrying a non-natural D-Ala residue at P3 (Figure 3), has high potency
and selectivity for β5i (IC50 values: 0.022 µM for β5i, 2.9 µM for β5c, 8.2 µM for β1i and >30 µM for
β1c, β2c and β2i; β5c/β5i ratio: 131) [86], though it was not tested for eﬀectiveness in autoimmune dis‐
eases. Instead, it was reported that PR-924 selectively induces cell death of human multiple myeloma
cell lines and suppresses grafted multiple myeloma in mice [117]. However, these anti-proliferative ef‐
fects required high drug concentrations that were likely not compatible with isoform-selective CP inhi‐
bition [118].

2/19/24, 10:57 AM

Despite these unsatisfactory results, the unusual stereochemistry of PR-924 and its exceptional β5i-se‐
lectivity were further investigated by academic groups. Derivatives of PR-924, combining various P1and P2-residues as well as N-cap structures with a D-Ala residue at P3, were designed and evaluated for
their subunit selectivity. Among them, LU-035i emerged as the most potent and selective compound
(IC50 values in Raji cell lysates: 0.011 µM for β5i; β5i-selectivity: 500 over β5c; Table 1) [73]. In the
course of this study it was noted that inhibitors with a P3-D-Ala residue and a 3-methyl-1H-indene Ncap, like PR-924 and LU-035i, display high β5i-selectivity (Table 1). Notably, this eﬀect was not based
on enhanced β5i-potency, but rather due to poor inhibition of β5c. As initial structural data could not
explain this diﬀerence in performance [73], X-ray crystallographic data with humanized yeast protea‐
somes were collected. The structures visualized distinct binding modes for PR-924 in β5c/β6- and β5i/
β6-substrate binding channels, respectively [106]. Consistent with the non-natural stereochemistry at
P3, PR-924 adopts a kinked conformation in humanized β5i-proteasome structures, with the N-cap oc‐
cupying a S3*-sub-pocket that cannot be approached by natural ligands. By contrast, at the β5c/β6-ac‐
tive site and in yeast CP crystal structures, PR-924 adopts a linear conformation that is assumed to be
energetically disfavored and associated with poor aﬃnity, thereby causing enhanced β5i-selectivity
[106]. This eﬀect applies to all derivatives of PR-924 with a P3-D-Ala residue and a 3-methyl-1H-in‐
dene cap, and was also found by two independent modelling studies [87,119]. Inhibitors with smaller
N-caps bind to β5c and β5i in their kinked mode and thus lose β5i-selectivity. This result also indicates
that the S3*-sub-pocket is larger in β5i than in β5c, although no pronounced structural diﬀerences could
be spotted so far to explain the distinct binding modes. Furthermore, PR-924 and its derivatives show
high selectivity for human β5i (>130-fold over β5c) but significantly lower preference for mouse β5i
(16-fold over mouse β5c). While Val31 of human β5i is compatible with PR-924 binding, Met31 of
mouse β5i sterically interferes with the kinked binding mode of PR-924, as well as its derivatives [106].
Usually, most inhibitors target proteasomes from distinct species with comparable potency, as the sub‐
strate binding channels are similar in primary, secondary and tertiary structure. However, when target‐
ing non-canonical sites aside from the natural substrate binding pockets, the amino acids are not that
well conserved. This fact complicates drug development and evaluation in preclinical studies, as diﬀer‐
ent species can produce diﬀerent outcomes. Therefore, animals for preclinical trials have to be carefully
chosen and any disagreement in the amino acid lining of inhibitor target sites needs to be evaluated be‐
forehand. In this regard, the ligand binding site of the target protein should be studied by structural
means in early drug development stages.
Only recently, Kezar Life Sciences Inc. reported another β5i-selective inhibitor (compound 8 (Figure 3,
Table 1); IC50 values determined in MOLT-4 cell lysates: 0.034 µM for β5i; 78-fold selectivity for β5i
over β5c) [87]. Notably, compound 8 failed to control cytokine release in in vitro studies and disease
progression in mice suﬀering from active collagen antibody-induced arthritis [87]. This report further
substantiates the suspicion that single-subunit-selective inhibitors are poorly active as therapeutic
agents (see also Section 5).

4.4. Therapeutic Potential of Subunit-Selective iCP Inhibitors

2/19/24, 10:57 AM

The identification of numerous highly subunit-selective inhibitors and more sophisticated methods to
assay proteasome activities in vitro and in vivo allowed for a more thorough analysis of the biological
eﬀects and medicinal potential of iCP inhibition. These studies questioned the initial assumption that
blockage of a single iCP subunit like β5i is suﬃcient to cause therapeutic benefits in autoimmune dis‐
eases.
Among the β1i-inhibitors, ML604440, KZR-504 and LU-001i failed to generate therapeutically rele‐
vant responses [76,87,91,93], and the anti-cancer activity reported for UK-101 [97] likely arises from
co-inhibition of other CP activities [98]. Whether the beneficial eﬀects of DB-310 in Alzheimer’s dis‐
ease result from co-inhibition of other proteasome subunits as well, or from disease-specific circum‐
stances, needs to be further explored [75]. In this regard, it is worth mentioning that most compounds
are evaluated for their eﬃcacy in diﬀerent disease models and distinct settings, precluding any system‐
atic comparison and reliable judgement of their bioactivity. For example, in the central nervous system,
iCP inhibition has recently been correlated with disease worsening instead of improvement, thus de‐
manding for careful selection of preclinical models [120].
Regarding β5i-selective inhibitors, PRN1126, compound 8 (Kezar Life Sciences Inc.) and compound
22 (Genentech Inc.) were found to be therapeutically inactive [65,69,87]. Whereas the reason for failure
of PRN1126 and compound 8 was attributed to their single-subunit inhibition profile [69,87], Genen‐
tech Inc. argued that immune cells undermine iCP inhibition by inducing cCP expression, and thus es‐
cape apoptosis [65]. Notably, the study of Genentech Inc. aimed at inducing cell death in immune cells,
while others including Kezar Life Sciences Inc. looked for a reduction in cytokine production without
compromising cell viability. Although the outlined discrepancies may result from diﬀerences in readout, target applications, applied concentrations etc., further evaluations are certainly required. For PR924 [117] and M3258 [66], pronounced anti-cancer activity has been described in multiple myeloma
tumor models. However, the eﬀects observed for PR-924 are suspected to originate from co-inhibition
of other CP activities [118]. It thus remains to be evaluated whether the activity of M3258 indeed re‐
sults from single-subunit inhibition or from a high β5i-dependence of multiple myeloma cells as pro‐
posed by the authors [66]. In summary, with few exceptions, iCP inhibitors with high single-subunit
selectivity appear to not have the expected therapeutic eﬀects in vitro and in preclinical animal models
of autoimmune diseases [47].

5. Pan-Immunoproteasome Reactive Inhibitors
Increasing evidence for the therapeutic failure of single-subunit-selective iCP inhibitors in inflammato‐
ry diseases promoted the search for compounds that target at least two iCP subunits. Specifically, coinhibition of β1i and β5i, or β2i and β5i, appears to drive anti-inflammatory activity [87]. Based on
these findings, the collection of known pan-reactive iCP inhibitors was recently supplemented by new
compounds and will certainly grow further in the future.

5.1. Non-Covalent Amides
Ettari et al. recently published the non-covalent amide 6 (Figure 3) that targets β1i- and β5i-subunits of
the iCP (Ki values for purified human CPs: 4.9 µM for β1i and 4.4 µM for β5i; Table 1) and inhibits
proliferation of a dexamethasone-resistant human multiple myeloma cell line (EC50: 17.8 µM) [88]. As
inhibition values for the corresponding cCP subunits have not been determined, the iCP selectivity of
amide 6 is elusive and remains to be proven.

5.2. IPSI-001
Initially declared as a β1i-specific inhibitor, IPSI-001 was one of the first iCP-selective compounds.
This peptide aldehyde, also known as calpeptin (Figure 3), was shown to target subunit β1i of the iCP
and induce apoptosis in multiple myeloma cells [89], but later this bioactivity was claimed to result
from co-inhibition of β5c- and β5i-subunits [86]. Detailed and accurate evaluation of the subunit selec‐
tivity profile of IPSI-001 is essential to assess its potential as pan-reactive iCP inhibitor. To this end,
further optimizations with respect to potency, stability and cross-reactivity might be required. So far,
the low potency of IPSI-001 precluded in vivo studies [89]. Moreover, its aldehyde head group is prone
to oxidative inactivation and well known to co-inhibit serine and cysteine proteases [121]. The latter
feature can be beneficial to potential applications due to synergistic eﬀects, or detrimental because of
unwanted side eﬀects.

5.3. Boronates
A patent filed by Roche reports about substituted triazole boronic acid compounds, among which ligand
1b (Figure 3; originally published as 1) has pronounced β1i- and β5i-selectivity (IC50 values of 0.002
µM for β5i and 0.039 µM for β5c, as well as 0.004 µM for β1i and 0.32 µM for β1c) [90]. Based on this
report, Genentech Inc. and Proteros Biostructures GmbH created derivatives of 1b that are even more
selective β5i-/β1i-inhibitors [65]. The compounds were not cytotoxic to immune cells, but anti-inflam‐
matory activity was not examined.

5.4. LU-005i
A screen of ONX 0914 derivatives for improved β5i-selectivity led to the identification of LU-005i.
Instead of a Phe residue, LU-005i features a cyclohexyl moiety at P1 (Figure 3) [73]. It shows activity
towards subunits β1i, β2i and β5i with decent selectivity over the respective constitutive subunits (IC50
values for purified CPs: 0.052 µM for β1i, 0.47 µM for β2i and 0.16 µM for β5i; β1c/β1i ratio: >19;
β2c/β2i ratio: 6; β5c/β5i ratio: 18; Table 1) and thus is considered a pan-immunoproteasome-selective
inhibitor [91]. As the first reported compound that targets all three iCP subunits over the respective con‐

stitutive subunits, LU-005i was probed for its biological activity and therapeutic potential. These stud‐
ies revealed that LU-005i is able to lower MHC-I surface expression and cytokine production. More‐
over, LU-005i blocks diﬀerentiation of Th17 helper cells and alleviates symptoms of dextran sulfate
sodium-induced colitis in mice [91].

5.5. ONX 0914
Reported in 2009, ONX 0914 (formerly PR-957) was the first CP inhibitor with moderate β5i-selectivi‐
ty (nine-fold over β5c) and emerged as the lead compound for iCP inhibitor development in general (
Table 1, Figure 3) [63]. In vitro, it reduces MHC-I expression, presentation of β5i-dependent antigens,
as well as cytokine production and blocks Th17 diﬀerentiation [63]. ONX 0914 selectively induces
apoptosis of CD14+ monocytes, thereby reducing IL-23 production and suppressing Th17 diﬀerentia‐
tion [122]. The potential of ONX 0914 to serve as a new treatment of chronic inflammations and au‐
toimmune diseases was initially shown in mouse models of rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes mellitus
type I [63], and later confirmed in a plethora of other preclinical studies, including experimental colitis
[123], myasthenia gravis [124], Hashimoto’s thyroiditis [125], systemic lupus erythematosus [126], im‐
mune thrombocytopenia [93], experimental neuritis [127], autoimmune myocarditis [128] and multiple
sclerosis [120,129] (for a complete list see [47]). In addition, as exemplified with ONX 0914, the iCP
might qualify as a target to prevent transplant rejection [130], graft-versus-host disease [131] and
pathogen-induced immunopathology [132]. Despite this excellent performance without cytotoxic side
eﬀects [133], unfavorable solubility properties of ONX 0914 prevented its evaluation in clinical trials
[87].
The beneficial eﬀects found with ONX 0914 were initially attributed to its β5i-selectivity. The develop‐
ment of inhibitors with improved subunit selectivity profiles, however, revealed that β5i-selective com‐
pounds are inferior to ONX 0914 with respect to biological activity in autoimmune diseases. Reassess‐
ment of ONX 0914 finally uncovered a substantial co-inhibition of ~60% of subunit β1i and marginal
β2i-blockage at eﬃcacious doses [87]. Most likely, this combined iCP subunit inhibition, or at least par‐
tial blockage of a second site, is required for the anti-inflammatory features of ONX 0914 [87]. Experi‐
mental proof for this theory was provided by assays with combinations of subunit-selective inhibitors.
ML604440/LU-001i (β1i) and PRN1126 (β5i) [69], as well as KZR-504 (β1i) and compound 8 (β5i)
[87], eﬃciently suppressed cytokine expression, while the single agents or combinations of β1i- and
dual β2c/β2i-inhibitors failed. In fact, a combination of compound 8, KZR-504 and a β2-inhibitor, mim‐
icking pan-iCP reactivity, was most eﬀective but also killed 30% of stimulated immune cells [87].
While in the beginning ONX 0914 was the only available compound to study physiological eﬀects of
iCP inhibition, a plenitude of compounds is now available to assess all kinds of subunit combinations in
detail for their bioactivity and to balance the right inhibition strength for the desired application. This is
particularly important, as ONX 0914 was found to have adverse eﬀects on disease progression when
applied in the chronic phase of a mouse model of multiple sclerosis [120].

5.6. KZR-616
In an eﬀort to find a compound with a similar subunit selectivity profile as ONX 0914 but improved
physico-chemical properties for clinical applications, Kezar Life Sciences Inc. (formerly Onyx Pharma‐
ceuticals Inc.) developed KZR-616 [87]. KZR-616 potently co-inhibits subunits β1i and β5i of iCPs
(IC50 values for human cell lysates: 0.039 µM for β5i and 0.131 µM for β1i; β1c/β1i ratio: >80; β5c/β5i
ratio: 17; Table 1, Figure 3) and displays broad anti-inflammatory activity [134]. Due to its superior
activity in rheumatic diseases and its favorable physicochemical properties compared with ONX 0914
[135,136], it rapidly entered phase I trials for safety evaluation. Although the compound was found to
be well tolerated, prednisone and antihistamines were required to prevent systemic drug reactions upon
first administration of KZR-616 [137]. In agreement with preclinical investigations that ruled out inhi‐
bition of intracellular proteases other than the CP [87], no cytotoxic eﬀects were observed [137]. Fur‐
thermore, the immune system was not generally compromised. At an applied dose of 45 mg, KZR-616
blocks ~95% of β5i and ~70% of β2i [137]. This positive rating allowed KZR-616 to enter a phase Ib/II
trial in patients suﬀering from systemic lupus erythematosus with and without lupus nephritis (NC‐
T03393013), and in two phase II studies for active polymyositis or dermatomyositis (NCT04033926),
as well as active autoimmune hemolytic anemia or immune thrombocytopenia (NCT04039477). Due to
the COVID-19 pandemic, the latter trial was recently withdrawn before first patients were enrolled.
Combined, KZR-616 has the potential to advance to a novel and eﬀective therapy for chronic inflamma‐
tory diseases in the future and to bring selective iCP inhibition to clinical application. This encouraging
development will certainly promote other pharmaceutical companies to raise their budget for protea‐
some inhibitor research.

6. Conclusions
During the last decade, the iCP emerged as a drug target for various diseases. While chronic inflamma‐
tions and hematological cancers range at the forefront of this development, other potential applications
such as treatment of solid tumors, neurodegenerative disorders and infectious diseases either need fur‐
ther exploration or are just entering the stage. Only time can tell us whether the iCP will be approved as
a druggable target and whether another chapter can be added to the success story of CP inhibition.
Either way, it is almost certain that the clinical utility of CP inhibitors in general will be expanded in
the future, at least in the form of combination therapies to overcome resistances or for the treatment of
non-responders. Aside from CP inhibitors, numerous compounds targeting CP-associated proteins, such
as the 19S-cap, are in development [138] and may find their application as well, thus guaranteeing the
proteasome, in any case, a prospering future.

Abstract
Mastitis is a rare condition that can be diagnosed in female cats of all breeds and ages. It is usually caused
by bacterial agents and is frequently encountered secondarily in feline mammary fibroepithelial hyperplasia
(FEH). If left untreated, it can peril both the queen and her kittens. Therefore, a reliable and quick diagnosis
is the primary key to successful treatment. Conventional diagnosis consists of a clinical and ultrasound
evaluation of the queen’s mammary glands. However, there is a lack of literature specifically focused on

mastitis in queens. Consequently, the present review brings forth the existing knowledge regarding
mammary gland inflammations in cats, with the goal of improving current clinical evaluation and treatment
plans.

1. Introduction
Mastitis is a rarely reported condition in this particular species. The existing literature does not provide
sufficient information on the prevalence of mastitis. However, it is worth noting that mastitis may
commonly occur as a secondary condition to feline mammary fibroepithelial hyperplasia (FEH) (Chisholm,
1993, Payan-Carreira, 2013). Furthermore, mastitis can affect all actively lactating, nursing, puerperal, or
pseudopregnant queens (Johnston et al., 2001, Root Kustritz, 2010).
In cats, there are recognized cases of mammary gland inflammation categorized as nonseptic (i.e.,
galactostasis) and septic (i.e., acute mastitis, gangrenous mastitis, and chronic mastitis) (Akgül and Kaya,
2016, Al-salihi et al., 2018, Burstyn, 2010, Demirel and Ergin, 2014, Park et al., 2007, Roudebush and Wheeler,
1979, Tawfik et al., 2020, Wilson, 2013).
However, in bitches and cats, mastitis is considered an emergency (Biddle and Macintire, 2000, Jutkowitz,
2005, Vasiu et al., 2020). The presence of acute mastitis, and especially the development of gangrenous
mastitis, poses a similar risk to both queens and their litters (Al-salihi et al., 2018, Demirel and Ergin, 2014,
Roudebush and Wheeler, 1979, Wilson, 2013).
This systematic review aims to consolidate all relevant information on feline nonseptic and septic mastitis
while assessing the specific characteristics of this species. Furthermore, the review will cover the treatment
and prophylactic measures for this condition.

2. Materials and methods
A comprehensive systematic review was conducted to explore the available literature on mastitis in queens.
To gather relevant data, searches were performed using Google Scholar and PubMed. The search terms
employed included “queen,” “cat,” “feline,” “mastitis,” “mammary gland,” “inflammation,” “infection,” and
“pathology.” Various definitions and combinations of these terms were utilized to find the necessary

information.
The search strategy was restricted to include only papers published in English, resulting in the exclusion of
papers edited in different languages, such as Indonesian and Russian. The database search encompassed the
earliest year for which data was available. Additionally, the reference lists of all articles and reports were
examined to identify any relevant published articles that might not have been indexed in the selected
database. In case further information was necessary, the corresponding authors of the selected papers were
contacted.
Hard copies of any articles or other reports not available in the University of Agricultural Sciences and
Veterinary Medicine Library, Cluj-Napoca, Romania, were obtained from other European libraries through
the University’s interlibrary loan services.
The authors chose articles from the search results by assessing titles and abstracts, excluding those
irrelevant to the topic at hand (such as mastitis in women, mastitis in bitches, mastitis in ruminants,
mastitis in rabbits does, or mastitis in other small companion animals). Subsequently, all the chosen articles
underwent a comprehensive review of their full texts, conducted independently by the authors (IV, RD). In
cases of disagreement, resolutions were reached through mutual consent. The study includes all the
relevant data obtained from the literature, including case reports, research papers, book chapters, reviews,
and symposium abstracts.

3. Results
A total of 23 research papers were identified as eligible for inclusion in this review. Among these, 11
(47.83%) were categorized as case reports (see Table 1, Table 5 (21.74%) were book chapters, 3 (13.04%) were
reviews, and 4 (17.39%) were symposium abstracts. However, it should be noted that one case report was
unavailable for online consultation and therefore excluded from the analysis.

The following sections will delve into the existing literature on mammary congestion and various forms of
mastitis, such as galactostasis, subclinical mastitis, acute mastitis, gangrenous mastitis, and chronic mastitis.
In addition, this discussion will provide an overview of certain anatomical and physiological aspects of
healthy mammary glands in queens, along with a description of normal clinical findings.

3.1. Mammary glands in queens
In queens, the mammary gland configuration typically consists of one pair of inguinal mammary glands,
two pairs of abdominal mammary glands, and a single pair of thoracic mammary glands (Englar, 2019,
Hughes, 2021, Johnston et al., 2001). In cats, the mammary gland structure comprises the mammary body
and the teat. The mammary body consists of numerous lobes, lactiferous ducts, and sinuses. Each lobe
contains numerous lobules housing milk secretory alveoli and multiple milk ducts lined with contractile

myoepithelial cells. The mammary teat is characterized by the presence of several sinuses and papillary
ducts. These ducts are lined with squamous epithelium, corresponding to each galactophore system. The
distal end of the teat is closed by a sphincter composed of three layers of circular muscle tissue and is
equipped with multiple papillary orifices. Each mammary gland typically comprises 4–8 galactophore
systems (Hughes, 2021, Johnston et al., 2001). Furthermore, it is worth noting that the cat mammary gland
is considered to have terminal ductal lobular units (Hughes, 2021).
The mammary tissue of cats exhibits the expression of progesterone and estrogen receptors. During the
prepubertal and postpubertal stages, mammary epithelial cell proliferation is stimulated by estrogen. In the
diestrus phase and late gestation, mammary genesis development is stimulated by progesterone,
somatotropic hormone (STH), and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF – 1)(Hughes, 2021).
Histological variations described in the bitch mammary glands during estrus can also be found in cats
(Chandra et al., 2010). However, it is important to note that cats are seasonally polyestrous and have induced
ovulation (Hughes, 2021). The available literature on the morpho-functional changes in queen mammary
glands during gestation, lactation, and involution periods is limited (Hughes, 2021).
To ensure the healthy and robust development of kittens, mammary secretion provides essential nutrition
and immunological support. It offers protection against infectious diseases through the presence of
lactobacilli, which serve as a natural source of probiotics for the intestinal microflora of the kittens.
Additionally, the mammary secretion contains leukocytes, immunocompetent cells, IgA, fatty acids,
lysozyme, lactoferrin, proteins, cytokines, and other milk compounds that will help in the fight for
homeostasis (Chastant-Maillard et al., 2017, Jiménez et al., 2013).
However, compared to the bitch milk heterogenic microbiological composition (Vasiu et al., 2021, Vasiu et
al., 2020), there is limited literature available regarding the microbiome of queen’s milk to date (Table 2).
However, based on the available knowledge, the reported bacteria in the milk of queens include
Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus hirae, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus plantarum, Staphylococcus aureus, and
Staphylococcus simulans (Akgül and Kaya, 2016, Demirel and Ergin, 2014, Jiménez et al., 2013, Roudebush and
Wheeler, 1979, Wilson, 2013). In addition, Toxoplasma gondii has been identified and isolated from queen’s
milk as well (Park et al., 2007).

3.2. Clinical assessment of the mammary chains in queens
Usually, queens have four pairs of mammary glands, with each gland being associated with a mammary teat
(Englar, 2019, Hughes, 2021, Johnston et al., 2001). The hairs surrounding the mammary glands are usually
concealed within the fur, requiring its removal or separation for examination, especially in prepubertal and
nulliparous queens. Teats are more noticeable in queens that have previously queened (Englar, 2019).
It is important to palpate both mammary chains during the examination. The mammary tissue should feel
soft and nonsensitive to the touch. In a healthy state, there should be no palpable masses within the
mammary parenchyma. Any sign of local modification, including heat, redness, congestion, engorging, an
abnormal discharge, or asymmetrical mammary glands may be indicative of inflammation in the mammary
glands (Englar, 2019).
The teats need to be counted and inspected to ensure the integrity of their surfaces. The skin surrounding
each teat should be free from any peri-areolar injuries, such as dermatitis. In lactating queens, it is
important to manually squeeze each gland to assess milk production and consistency (Englar, 2019).
Additionally, when a mass is present within a gland, it is necessary to examine the inguinal and thoracic
lymph nodes to confirm the absence of local metastasis.

3.3. Ultrasound of the queen’s mammary glands
The mammary glands in queens have a limited amount of glandular tissue, which makes them unique to the
species. As a result, the thickness of the mammary gland varies significantly depending on its physiological

12 MHz linear transducer is commonly used.

In unstimulated, intact, nulliparous, and adult queens, the abdominal wall is thicker than the mammary
gland tissue. During lactation, the size of the glands is influenced by the presence of a suckling stimulus. In
the first 40 days of gestation, there is a slight development of the mammary glands. After 40 days,
substantial growth of glandular tissue occurs in late gestation, and the maximum mammary gland
development is reached after queening (Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3). Moreover, the puerperal non-lactating glands
are smaller, similar to those in late gestation (Table 3). Furthermore, ductal structures can only be visualized
during the periparturient period (Payan-Carreira and Martins-Bessa, 2008).

days of gestation. The mammary glands are physiologically enlarged and have characteristic moderate
echogenicity (1a, b, c, d), blurred structure with visible increased flow in the Doppler examination (1d).
Furthermore, small anechogenic areas are noticed in the mammary tissue, corresponding to ductal
structures. The dorsal margins of the mammary glands are more hyperechoic and distinct than during the
early stages of pregnancy. For the inguinal mammary glands, the parenchyma thickens varied between 11.0
mm (1a) and 14.2 mm (1c), while in the abdominal mammary glands, the thickness of the parenchyma was
5.2 mm (1b). Abbreviations: DSH - domestic shorthair cat.

The US revealed the presence of significantly enlarged, irregular heterogeneous mammary glands with
visible increased flow in the Doppler examination (3b). Additionally, the mammary tissue acquires a more
hypoechogenic pattern, and some small anechogenic areas are evidenced in the parenchyma, possibly
corresponding to ductal structures of the mammary gland. Mammary gland capsules are also emboldened.
The characteristic echogenicity of the distinct layers is lost with uneven shape and unclear edges.
Abbreviations: DSH - domestic shorthair cat; FEH - fibroepithelial hyperplasia; US – ultrasound

During US examination of the mammary tissue, it is important to carefully observe the characteristics of its
margins and the surrounding healthy glandular tissue in a specific area. The appearance of the margins can
provide valuable information for differentiating between benign and malignant lesions. Benign lesions
typically exhibit regular and well-defined boundaries, uniform echogenicity within focal lesions, and a
proper US image of the surrounding tissue. On the other hand, malignant changes are often characterized by
irregular boundaries and echo distribution within the lesion’s parenchyma. They may also show the
presence of an areola surrounding the focal lesion with reduced echogenicity, resembling a “halo.”
Additionally, infiltration of the tissue bordering the lesion, indicated by the absence of clear boundaries,
suggests the need for fine needle aspiration (FNA) for further evaluation. Furthermore, hyperemia, which
refers to increased vascularity, can be observed in cases of mammary inflammation, indicating increased
arterial and venous structures (Leong et al., 2018).
Furthermore, in cats during the postpartum period, abnormalities in the lactiferous ducts can be observed,
such as dilatation of the ducts accompanied by thickened walls and contents. This may result in the
accumulation of fluid within the inflamed area. The contents of these accumulations typically exhibit a
hypoechoic and heterogeneous appearance, and the walls may appear irregularly thickened. It is also
possible for the accumulations to form fistulas that connect with the skin or intramammary ducts (Leong et
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037843202300132X?via%3Dihub

al., 2018).
Finally, mammary US should be assessed in cases where kittens are not gaining weight, females experience
discomfort during nursing, or the queens exhibit hyperthermia. By doing so, US evaluation can reveal
certain findings such as hypoechogenic, coarse-grained heterogeneous areas within the mammary tissue,
which may indicate acute septic mastitis. Hypoechogenic fluid pocket accumulations, suggestive of
abscesses, can also be detected. Additionally, mammary fibrosis or other types of nodules may present as
hyperechogenic areas with hypoechoic heterogeneity (Bassu, 2017, Davidson and Baker, 2009, Trasch et al.,
2007, Trasch and Wehrend, 2008).
It should be remembered that the mammary US is undeniably valuable as a diagnostic tool. However, it
should be noted that it is an additional examination, and a final diagnosis often requires combining it with
the histopathological examination (Seweryn and Tworus, 2012).

3.4. Mastitis
3.4.1. Definition
Mastitis is characterized by inflammation of the glandular tissue and can affect one or multiple mammary
glands simultaneously. A wide range of variations, from nonseptic galactostasis to septic, acute, gangrenous,
or chronic inflammations, have been described, leading to a spectrum of asymptomatic (subclinical) to
acute mastitis episodes (Johnston et al., 2001, Vasiu et al., 2020). Due to the limited amount of glandular
tissue outside the periparturient period, mastitis primarily affects puerperal and lactating queens (Johnston
et al., 2001, Root Kustritz, 2010).

3.4.2. Etiology and pathogenesis
However, the factors that contribute to the development of septic inflammations in the mammary glands
are similar to those observed in other species (Vasiu et al., 2020). The most common route of infection is
through the ascending path, where the infection spreads to the mammary tissue through the papillar
opening of the teat or skin lesions on the mammary glands (Englar, 2019, Wallace, 1994, Zambelli, 2012).
Skin and environmental bacterial strains are primarily responsible for causing mammary gland infections
(Englar, 2019, Root Kustritz, 2010).
Furthermore, various factors can contribute to teats and mammary gland lesions, such as scratches from
kittens during feeding, periodontitis followed by licking of the mammary glands, poor environmental
hygiene, mammary gland congestion or galactostasis, and excessive manipulation of the mammary glands
by humans. These factors can predispose the mammary glands to primary or secondary infections (Englar,
2019, Graham and Taylor, 2012, Zambelli, 2012). Moreover, in queens, several studies have described
mastitis as being secondary to FEH (Chisholm, 1993, MacDougall, 2003, Payan-Carreira, 2013).

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037843202300132X?via%3Dihub

Page 11 of 31

A systematic review of mammary gland inflammations in queens (Felis catus) - ScienceDirect

2/19/24, 11:15 AM

Moreover, mastitis can occur as a secondary condition to metritis, and in some cases, it can be diagnosed
simultaneously, indicating the possibility of hematogenous bacterial translocation. Furthermore, systemic
illnesses such as bacteremia, postpartum gastrointestinal inflammations resulting from placental or vulvar
discharge and ingestion of meconium, and the presence of intestinal parasites that become active and
migrate to the intestinal tract can also act as predisposing factors for septic inflammations in the mammary
glands (Bassu, 2017, Wallace, 1994).
On the other hand, there is limited information available regarding the occurrence of subsequent mastitis
episodes in future lactations of affected queens, as signaled in bitches, although this cannot be discarded
(Bassu, 2017, Demirel and Ergin, 2014, Englar, 2019, Johnston et al., 2001, Wiebe and Howard, 2009).
In cases of nonseptic galactostasis, prolonged contact between the casein in the milk and the bloodstream
can trigger a type one local hypersensitivity reaction. This reaction leads to the release of biogenic amines
by basophils and mast cells. As a result, there is an increased presence of eosinophils in the affected
mammary glands. Furthermore, if galactostasis is left unrecognized or untreated, septic inflammatory
conditions can develop on top of the existing galactostasis (Day, 2008, Johnston et al., 2001, Vasiu et al.,
2020).

3.4.3. Mammary congestion
Mammary glands that are congested appear swollen and sensitive, causing discomfort for the lactating
queen. In addition, simple congestion of the glands can increase the risk of inflammation and secondary
bacterial invasion (Zambelli, 2012).
Management of mammary congestion typically involves the use of warm water compresses and local
massaging. Allowing the kittens to continue nursing is also important to avoid complications such as the
development of galactostasis (Demirel and Ergin, 2014, Zambelli, 2012). However, due to the limited
available data, further research is needed to provide a more comprehensive understanding of mammary
congestion in queens.

3.4.4. Galactostasis
Nonseptic galactostasis, also known as aseptic mastitis, refers to the production and accumulation of milk in
the mammary sinuses due to an imbalance between milk production and consumption. It is associated with
inflammatory conditions but does not involve an infectious component such as fever or other systemic signs
(Bassu, 2017, Holst, 2022, Zachary, 2017).
In queens, various factors can contribute to the development of nonseptic galactostasis, including neonatal
mortality, small litter size, premature weaning, pseudopregnancy, mastitis, pain, or congenital
abnormalities of the mammary duct. However, overproduction of milk may also occur without any
identifiable cause. The thoracic mammary pair is reported to have a higher incidence of galactostasis
(Demirel and Ergin, 2014, Holst, 2022, Martí, 2009, Orfanou et al., 2016, Prescott, 1972, Vasiu et al., 2020,
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037843202300132X?via%3Dihub

2/19/24, 11:15 AM

Wallace, 1994, Zambelli, 2012).
Mammary glands affected by galactostasis can exhibit swelling, pain, and firmness, causing visible
discomfort when the queen is nursed (Holst, 2022, Wallace, 1994, Zambelli, 2012). If galactostasis is left
unrecognized, it can lead to complications such as mammary fistula or the development of acute or chronic
mastitis.
If nursing is still desired, warm water compresses, gentle stripping of the mammary glands, and
encouraging the kittens to nurse can be helpful. On the other hand, if nursing is not desired, limiting food
intake, applying cold water compresses, and administering diuretics may help alleviate inflammation and
reduce lactation (Demirel and Ergin, 2014, Holst, 2022, Wallace, 1994, Wiebe and Howard, 2009, Zambelli,
2012).
However, given the scarce data available, future research should also focus on galactostasis in queens.

3.4.5. Subclinical and chronic mastitis
Subclinical cases of mastitis in cats refer to infections that lack obvious clinical signs of inflammation.
Unfortunately, there is a lack of available data regarding subclinical mastitis in cats. However, it is important
to consider that asymptomatic forms of mastitis can have significant consequences, including reduced
weight gain in neonates, fetal or neonatal mortality, or even the loss of the entire litter (Englar, 2019, Holst,
2022).
The ascending route of infection is the primary cause of subclinical mammary gland infections in
postpartum queens, which can be attributed to factors such as suckling kittens or damp and unsanitary
environmental conditions (Barsanti, 2012, Bassu, 2017). Any litter in which there is excessive mortality or
where the kittens fail to thrive should raise suspicion of subclinical mammary inflammation. However, it is
still unclear whether subclinical cases are the cause or the result of a bacterial translocation between
queens and kittens (Martí, 2009).
Chronic cases of mastitis in cats can occur as primary infections or as a result of untreated or undiagnosed
acute mastitis. However, in queens, chronic mastitis is rarely observed, and there are only a few references
acknowledging its presence. It is more commonly seen as an incidental finding in older cats. Furthermore,
the mammary glands’ modifications are discreet. However, in some cases, especially in geriatric cats, there
may be swollen areas with hard nodules that can resemble neoplasms (Martí, 2009, Refai, 1988, SchäferSomi, 2018).
In cases of chronic mastitis, the mammary glands may feel firm and hard due to the formation of
inflammatory connective tissue or small cystic dilations resulting from obstructed milk ducts (Bassu, 2017).
Usually, no systemic illness is acknowledged (Refai, 1988); however, the kittens can fail to thrive (Bassu,
2017).

Additionally, there have been reports of nodular mastitis in a 16-year-old Japanese cat caused by an
infection with T. gondii (Park et al., 2007). However, considering the systemic nature of toxoplasmosis, it is
likely that the development of mastitis in this particular case was symptomatic, and necropsy confirmed the
presence of toxoplasmosis spreading to other internal organs (Park et al., 2007).
In cases where subclinical or chronic mastitis is suspected, various laboratory tests should be performed to
aid in the diagnosis. These tests may include measuring milk pH, conducting cytology and microbiology
analysis (including susceptibility or blood cultures), performing a complete blood count (CBC), evaluating
the acute phase protein response (APPs), in serum and/or milk, performing aspiration and cytology of
masses, and utilizing US or X-ray imaging techniques (Bassu, 2017, Payan-Carreira, 2013, Vasiu et al., 2021)

^Creatinine and ALT values can be decreased due to emaciation or muscle mass reduction in females with mastitis

secondarily to FEH.

Specific abnormalities that may be identified in subclinical or chronic cases of inflammation include
leukocytosis, anemia, elevated milk pH, abnormal levels of APPs (such as SAA, CRP, fibrinogen, etc.), with
SAA as the major APPs in cats, an increased count of degenerated neutrophils with phagocytosis or foamy
cells in milk cytology, the presence of pathogenic microorganisms in milk samples, and the presence of an
inflammatory exudate within the tissues of chronically affected mammary glands (Bassu, 2017, Vasiu et al.,
2021).
In the treatment of chronic mastitis, the choice of antibiotics should be based on the results of culture and
susceptibility testing. It is important to consider the acidity of the milk, as some basic antimicrobials may
undergo ion trapping, making them less effective. Additionally, the lipid solubility of some compounds, such
as macrolides, should also be taken into account (Barsanti, 2012).
When administering antibiotic treatment for chronic mastitis in queens that are allowed to nurse, it is
important to consider the potential impact on the health and development of the kittens, as antibiotics can
readily pass through the milk. Therefore, using beta-lactam drugs (Table 5) as first-line antibiotics can be a
safe choice for the kittens while they are suckling.

3.4.6. Acute mastitis
In queens, acute mastitis is typically associated with lactation and the periparturient period, affecting one
or multiple mammary glands simultaneously. It is accompanied by both local symptoms, such as hot,
painful, swollen, and reddened mammary glands, as well as systemic signs of illness, including fever,
depression, and even neonatal death (Holst, 2022, Johnston et al., 2001, Martí, 2009, Refai, 1988).
The primary cause of acute mastitis is generally ascending bacterial infections, such as E. coli or S. simulans
(Akgül and Kaya, 2016). However, it can also be secondary to subclinical cases of mastitis or feline
eosinophilic dermatitis with subsequent abscess formation (Burstyn, 2010, Chisholm, 1993, Holst, 2022,
MacDougall, 2003).
3.4.6.1. Symptoms
In a 7-year-old Van cat, an acute case of mastitis caused by coinfection of E. coli and S. simulans was
observed by Akgül and Kaya (2016). The cat exhibited bruising extending from the nipple to the surrounding
mammary tissue, along with swelling, hardening, and severe local mammary pain. Additionally, difficulties
were encountered in collecting milk, as the consistency appeared purulent with a yellowish color. The
general signs of illness included loss of appetite, fatigue, depression, prolonged periods of lying without
movement, and reluctance to nurse the kittens (Akgül and Kaya, 2016).
Moreover, in some cases, the sudden death of apparently healthy kittens may occur in the early stages of
mastitis, with changes within the mammary glands becoming apparent later (Refai, 1988). Nevertheless,
pyrexia, emesis, dehydration (indicated by xerostomia, persistent skin turgor, and sunken eyes), agalactia,
failure to thrive, and weight loss in kittens, especially in immunosuppressed individuals, have also been
reported (Akgül and Kaya, 2016, Holst, 2022, Johnston et al., 2001, Root Kustritz, 2010, Zambelli, 2012).
Another case involved a 1-year-old postpartum domestic shorthair cat (DSH), as described by Burstyn
(2010). The cat had been experiencing FEH persisting for 8 weeks, which had complicated secondary
mastitis and abscess formation. The mammary glands exhibited enlargement, measuring approximately 10–
12 cm in diameter. They appeared asymmetric with a turgescent, venous appearance, and were hard and
painful to the touch. Furthermore, fluctuating purulent pockets and skin ulcers were observed around the
nipples, along with multiple peripapillary skin ulcers measuring 2–5 cm in size. There were also blue-toblack areas and fibrous septa separating the mammary tissue, creating potential fluid-filled pockets. The
affected cat exhibited a fever (41.3 °C), lethargy, anorectic, dehydration, discomfort during nursing, and
tachypneic (Burstyn, 2010). Some affected queens may become nonambulatory (cats are still able to move,
wag their tails but are not strong enough to support their own weight and walk) and exhibit pale mucous
membranes (Payan-Carreira, 2013).
Interestingly, another case involving FEH with secondary mastitis and ulcerations was documented in a 1.5year-old neutered male DSH cat undergoing hormonal therapy (MacDougall, 2003).

In cases of septic mastitis, regardless of the underlying cause, the presence of septic shock is indicated by
symptoms such as hyperventilation, tachycardia, hypotension, a delayed capillary refill time (CRT), and
muscle weakness (Akgül and Kaya, 2016, Burstyn, 2010, Chisholm, 1993, Johnston et al., 2001, Zambelli,
2012).
3.4.6.2. Diagnostic measures
The diagnosis of mastitis relies on a combination of factors, including the patient’s history, clinical
evaluation, and laboratory assays. One of the early signs to watch out for is fever during the postpartum
period, which can indicate the presence of mastitis or metritis. Therefore, it is advisable to encourage
owners to monitor the rectal temperature of their cats daily throughout the lactation period (Johnston et al.,
2001).
In the CBC, the presence of leukocytosis, neutrophilia with left shift and toxic neutrophils, and lymphopenia
are indicative (Johnston et al., 2001, Root Kustritz, 2010). Anemia may be apparent in cases with mastitis
secondarily to FEH (Burstyn, 2010, Payan-Carreira, 2013).
Blood biochemistry analysis can reveal decreased levels of creatinine and alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
levels, particularly in emaciated or anorectic queens. In the context of mastitis, milk cytology examination
often demonstrates the presence of degenerated neutrophils and bacteria on milk smears (Burstyn, 2010,
Johnston et al., 2001, Root Kustritz, 2010, Wallace, 1994).
In cases where mastitis is secondary to FEH, imaging techniques such as X-rays or US can be valuable tools
for identifying intramammary pockets filled with purulent exudate (Burstyn, 2010, Payan-Carreira, 2013).
3.4.6.3. Treatment
The treatment protocol for mastitis primarily involves antimicrobial therapy and analgesia (Table 5). In the
initial stages, a broad-spectrum antibiotic should be administered, and subsequently, specific antibiotics can
be chosen based on culture and sensitivity tests (Zambelli, 2012). Amoxicillin, amoxicillin with clavulanic
acid, cephalexin, or erythromycin are highly recommended options as they are considered safe for neonates
(Bassu, 2017, Englar, 2019, Holst, 2022, Johnston et al., 2001, Root Kustritz, 2010, Wallace, 1994, Wiebe and
Howard, 2009, Zambelli, 2012). However, drugs such as chloramphenicol, doxycycline, tetracycline, or
fluoroquinolones should only be used after separating the kittens from the queen (Holst, 2022, Johnston et
al., 2001).
The choice of antimicrobial drug class for treating mastitis, particularly in cases of acute or chronic
inflammation, is influenced by factors such as lipid solubility, pH, and the integrity of the blood–milk
barrier. The milk is slightly more acidic than the serum, and as a result, weak bases with high lipid solubility
tend to achieve higher therapeutic concentrations in the milk and are more likely to be excreted into it
(Barsanti, 2012, Grundy, 2018, Martí, 2009, Root Kustritz, 2010).

2/19/24, 11:15 AM

In cases of septic shock and septicemia, it is crucial to initiate intravenous (IV) fluid therapy, and the
affected queen should be treated as an intensive care patient, particularly if she has untreated FEH with
secondary mastitis, skin ulcers, or abscess formation (Payan-Carreira, 2013).
For mild cases, warm water compresses or warm hydrotherapy can be applied to the mammary glands to
promote drainage. Oxytocin may be administered SC every 30 min or intranasally (i.e., spray) every 4–6 h to
stimulate milk secretion. It is beneficial to conduct queening in a familiar environment to facilitate milk
release (Bassu, 2017), and the kittens should be allowed to suckle (Holst, 2022).
To address mastitis in nonlactating mammary glands, immersing the mammary glands in a diluted iodine
povidone solution with warm water once daily can be effective (Holst, 2022, Johnston et al., 2001).
Additionally, since nonlactating mammary glands have limited glandular tissue, any skin lesions present can
be treated as superficial open skin lesions (Johnston et al., 2001, Payan-Carreira and Martins-Bessa, 2008). It
is important to cover the affected and sensitive glands to prevent excoriations caused by nursing kittens
(Root Kustritz, 2010). If it is necessary to stop milk production and lactation, the use of a dopamine agonist
may be considered in certain cases (Table 5).
It should be noted that providing effective analgesia for queens can be challenging, as molecules are rapidly
eliminated through milk, similar to what is observed in lactating bitches. However, like puppies, kittens can
tolerate opioid analgesia, all these substances can pass through milk. If needed, the effects of opioids can be
easily reversed in cases of lethargy or when kittens refuse to suckle (Mathews, 2008, Root Kustritz, 2010).
3.4.6.4. Prognosis
Mastitis can have a detrimental effect on lactogenesis, potentially leading to impaired milk ejection or a
reduction in milk production (agalactia). However, if left untreated or undiagnosed, acute inflammations
can progress to abscess formation or even gangrene (Demirel and Ergin, 2014, Holst, 2022).

3.4.7. Gangrenous mastitis
Mammary gangrene can occur as a primary condition or as a complication of other mammary inflammatory
pathologies, such as abscess formation or subsequent tissue necrosis. It is characterized by local symptoms
such as blackened, cold, or ulcerated mammary glands, along with severe systemic signs of illness, including
sepsis (Johnston et al., 2001, Martí, 2009, Root Kustritz, 2010, Roudebush and Wheeler, 1979).
Various reports indicate that gangrenous mastitis predominantly affects young puerperal queens (typically
between 1 and 3 years of age) within the first two weeks after queening (Al-salihi et al., 2018, Demirel and
Ergin, 2014, Roudebush and Wheeler, 1979, Tawfik et al., 2020, Wilson, 2013).
However, the epidemiology of these reports is limited, making it difficult to determine if primiparous
females are more affected compared to multiparous females. Additionally, while the affected breeds
mentioned in the reports are DSH and Persian, it is important to note that these breeds are popular among
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037843202300132X?via%3Dihub

cat owners. Therefore, based solely on these few case reports, it is not possible to definitively conclude if
these breeds are more susceptible to the condition or not.
Gangrenous lesions in queens have been reported to be caused by monoinfections with S. aureus or
hemolytic E. coli (Demirel and Ergin, 2014, Roudebush and Wheeler, 1979) or coinfections involving both E.
coli and S. aureus (Al-salihi et al., 2018, Wilson, 2013). However, the specific causative agent of the
gangrenous lesion in the remaining case report mentioned (Tawfik et al., 2020) is not reported.
3.4.7.1. Symptoms
One week after parturition, a 1-year-old DSH, cat diagnosed with gangrenous mastitis caused by a
monoinfection with hemolytic E. coli displayed various symptoms. These included acute vomiting, poor
appetite, polyuria, dehydration, lethargy, muscle weakness, fever (39.5 °C), depression, and a whitish
mucoid discharge on the perineal region. One mammary gland appeared enlarged, firm, painful, and
discolored (Roudebush and Wheeler, 1979).
After 24 h, a distinct demarcation line between the adjacent mammary tissue and the surrounding tissue
became evident, with a bluish-green coloration and an elevated fever (40.7 °C). By 72 h, the fever decreased
(39.3 °C), the queen started to regain her appetite, and the affected mammary gland turned violet–black,
clearly delineated from the surrounding healthy tissue. Furthermore, on the fifth day of hospitalization, the
necrotic tissue of the mammary gland had completely separated, revealing a healthy bed of granulation
tissue. The wound nearly healed completely within 14 days of the initial consultation (Roudebush and
Wheeler, 1979).
In one case report, a 1-year-old primiparous mixed-breed cat, one week postpartum, was diagnosed with
gangrenous mastitis caused by a monoinfection with S. aureus. The cat exhibited symptoms such as
anorexia, dehydration, fever (40.2 °C), and tachypnea. One mammary gland appeared asymmetric, enlarged,
hyperemic, warm, edematous, and painful with ectatic mammary veins. The cat also had a viscous and
yellow mammary secretion (Demirel and Ergin, 2014).
In another case report, a 3-year-old DSH cat, 2 weeks postpartum, was diagnosed with gangrenous mastitis
caused by coinfection of E. coli and S. aureus. The cat displayed symptoms such as anorexia, lethargy, weight
loss, depression, fever (39.8 °C), tachycardia, tachypnea, dehydration, prolonged CRT, and pink mucous
membranes. One mammary gland was swollen, firm, and warm. However, three days after the initial
consultation, the affected mammary gland ruptured and was covered by a black necrotic skin flap.
Additionally, all the other mammary glands were swollen and erythematous (Wilson, 2013).
Thus, as reported in one DSH (Al-salihi et al., 2018) and one Persian cat (Tawfik et al., 2020), in case of
gangrenous mastitis caused by coinfections of E. coli and S. aureus, queens may present with a large open
wound on the mammary gland with abscess and necrotic tissue. As a result, the females are reluctant to
nurse, as they neglect the kittens and seek seclusion. Moreover, the milk secretion may have a dark-brown

2/19/24, 11:15 AM

color (Al-salihi et al., 2018).
If the untreated disease progresses, there is a possibility of developing endotoxemia in the event of an E. coli
infection. Additionally, the development of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), multiple
organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), and sepsis may occur (Al-salihi et al., 2018, Graham and Taylor, 2012,
Root Kustritz, 2010).
3.4.7.2. Diagnostics
The diagnosis of the condition is established through a combination of historical information, clinical
evaluation, and laboratory assays. Furthermore, in the mixed-breed queen, biochemistry assays yielded no
significant findings. However, CBC revealed hypochromic anemia and leukocytosis with lymphopenia
(Demirel and Ergin, 2014). On the other hand, in the DSH cat with gangrenous mastitis caused by hemolytic
E. coli, there was mild leukocytosis with a left shift and the presence of toxic neutrophils. High numbers of
degenerated neutrophils and bacteria were also observed on milk smears (Roudebush and Wheeler, 1979).
Furthermore, additional complementary assays such as milk pH, microbiology, and the APPs response could
be conducted using samples of milk and blood to further assist with the management of the case.
However, during the necropsy examination of the affected mammary tissue in the Persian cat with an open
necrotic mammary wound, distinct observations were made. The tissue appeared dark red and exhibited
multifocal to coalescing white, soft, and necrotic friable areas interspersed with a purulent exudate.
Furthermore, multiple foci of liquefactive necrosis were identified. Additionally, the histopathological
analysis demonstrated necrosis, tissue debris, bacterial colonies, and the presence of gas bubbles within the
affected gland (Tawfik et al., 2020).
3.4.7.3. Treatment
Similar to acute mastitis, it is crucial to initiate aggressive IV fluid therapy as queens with gangrenous
mastitis require intensive care. Antibiotic treatment is also essential. Therefore, pending the results of
culture and sensitivity tests, empirical treatment with amoxicillin or clavulanate amoxicillin is advised
(Table 5) (Al-salihi et al., 2018, Demirel and Ergin, 2014, Johnston et al., 2001, Wilson, 2013). In one case
(Roudebush and Wheeler, 1979), a combination of penicillin and gentamicin was administered before the
sensitivity results were available. However, it is not recommended to use gentamicin as the first-line
therapeutic agent due to the potential for severe side effects (Ramsey, 2017), particularly in geriatric
patients with underlying kidney, otic, or ocular impairments.
For local treatment, ethacridine powder (1 g/L water) can be utilized (Demirel and Ergin, 2014). Additionally,
warm local compresses with Epsom salt, given once or twice daily (e.g., 1–2 spoons in 250 mL warm water),
lavage with a diluted 0.9% betadine solution or warm water, or locally applied honey-embedded patches,
given twice daily, are recommended (Johnston et al., 2001, Wilson, 2013). Treatment with cabergoline can
be considered to suppress lactation while tamponing all mammary glands with Epsom salt and feeding wet

2/19/24, 11:15 AM

food are advisable measures (Wilson, 2013). It is important to cover the affected mammary glands to
prevent excoriation of the friable tissue (Root Kustritz, 2010).
Furthermore, in complicated cases that necessitate surgical intervention, the treatment protocol involves
debridement and removal of devitalized and necrotic tissues, followed by the placement of drainage tubes
(Demirel and Ergin, 2014, Root Kustritz, 2010). Upon making the incisions, the discharge of seropurulent
fluid may be observed (Demirel and Ergin, 2014). Additionally, after a few days of progression, areas with a
diameter of 2–3 cm exhibiting a lack of substance may become evident, surrounding the devitalized
necrotic-caseous tissues with hardened margins (Roudebush and Wheeler, 1979, Wilson, 2013).
Noteworthy, queens can endure severe necrotic processes while undergoing extensive wound healing
through contraction and epithelization (Roudebush and Wheeler, 1979). Therefore, it is advisable not to
hastily pursue radical surgical interventions, as the necrotic material typically undergoes a gradual process
of sloughing and self-discarding (Roudebush and Wheeler, 1979, Wilson, 2013). However, in severe cases
involving prolonged devitalized and necrotic tissue, it may be necessary to perform one or several
mastectomies on the same patient (Demirel and Ergin, 2014).
3.4.7.4. Prognostic
Lastly, according to reports, the queen’s health status should improve within 3–5 days of treatment. During
this time, the females are expected to exhibit signs of brightness, alertness, responsiveness, a healthy
appetite, and a stable mental state, with vital signs falling within the normal range (Al-salihi et al., 2018,
Roudebush and Wheeler, 1979, Wilson, 2013).
Unfortunately, the prognosis is challenging to determine. Many cases have not been published, and despite
all therapeutic measures, severe complications such as endotoxemia and sepsis may still arise, leading to a
high mortality rate.

3.5. The nursing kittens’ dilemma
Kittens should generally be allowed to nurse unless the queen is experiencing gangrenous mastitis or a
mammary fistula, or if her health status does not permit it. Allowing kittens to consume antibiotic-treated
milk can facilitate the drainage of the mammary gland and prevent episodes of galactostasis. Taking a
precise and pragmatic approach to mastitis cases enables the queen to continue nursing. However, if
antibiotic susceptibility results indicate the necessity of aminoglycosides, tetracycline, or chloramphenicolbased drugs, it is highly recommended to separate the kittens from the queen and utilize a milk replacer or
a foster mother instead (Al-salihi et al., 2018, Englar, 2019, Holst, 2022, Johnston et al., 2001, Roudebush and
Wheeler, 1979, Wiebe and Howard, 2009, Zambelli, 2012).

4. Conclusion
Mastitis in lactating queens should not be disregarded, as it can have negative implications for both the

differentiation of malignancy from
inflammation manifested as groundglass nodules (GGNs) on chest CT.

Methods
A total of 68 GGNs in 45 patients
(M:F = 24:21; mean age, 61) fulfilled
the following criteria: (a) nodules
composed of ≥50% ground-glass
opacity, (b) patients who underwent
integrated PET/CT within 1 week
following dedicated chest CT, (c)
definitive diagnosis determined by
pathological specimen or at least 9
months of follow-up, and (d) lesions
≥10 mm in diameter. 36 malignant
GGNs were pathologically proved as
adenocarcinoma (n = 20),
bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (n =
11), low-grade lymphoma (n = 3),
metastatic mucinous adenocarcinoma
(n = 1) and unknown low-grade
malignancy (n = 1). 32 inflammatory
GGNs were confirmed as pneumonic
infiltration as they had disappeared
on follow-up CT and were associated
with compatible clinical features (n =

26) or as chronic inflammation with
fibrosis by VATS biopsy (n = 6). Using
CT density histogram analysis, 14
were classified as pure GGNs and 54
as part-solid nodules. Integrated
PET/CT was evaluated by measuring
the maximum standardized uptake
value (SUV) at the region of interest
located at each lesion. The Mann–
Whitney U test was performed to
compare the SUV of malignancy and
inflammation. The optimal cut-off
value of SUV to differentiate
malignancy from inflammation was
determined using a receiver operating
characteristic-based positive test.
Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and
positive predictive values (PPV) and
negative predictive values (NPV)
were calculated at the level of the
optimal cut-off value. SUV showing
100% PPV for inflammatory GGNs
was evaluated.

Results
In part-solid nodules, the maximum
SUV was significantly higher in
inflammation (2.00 ± 1.18; range,
0.48–5.60) than in malignancy (1.26
± 0.71; range, 0.32–2.6) (P = 0.018).
On the other hand, in pure GGNs, the

maximum SUV of malignancy (0.64 ±
0.19; range, 0.43–0.96) and
inflammation (0.74 ± 0.28; range,
0.32–1.00) showed no difference (P
= 0.37). Using the optimal cut-off
value of SUV as 1.2 (P = 0.01)
sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, PPV
and NPV in part-solid nodules were
62.1%, 80.0%, 70.4%, 78.3% and
64.5%, respectively. Six part-solid
nodules, which showed a maximum
SUV of higher than 2.6, were all
inflammations.

Conclusion
The part-solid nodules with positive
FDG-PET could be inflammatory
nodules rather than malignant
nodules. This is a quite paradoxical
result when considering the basic
knowledge that malignant pulmonary
nodules have higher glucose
metabolism.

Abstract
Background
[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) has been widely used in on‐
cologic procedures such as tumor diagnosis and staging. However, false-positive rates have been high,
unacceptable and mainly caused by inflammatory lesions. Misinterpretations take place especially
when non-subcutaneous inflammations appear at the tumor site, for instance in the lung. The aim of the
current study is to evaluate the use of dynamic PET imaging procedure to diﬀerentiate in situ and sub‐
cutaneous non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) from inflammation, and estimate the kinetics of
inflammations in various locations.

Dynamic FDG-PET Imaging to Differentiate Malignancies from Inflam… Situ Mouse Model for Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma (NSCLC) - PMC

2/19/24, 11:26 AM

Dynamic FDG-PET was performed on 33 female mice inoculated with tumor and/or inflammation sub‐
cutaneously or inside the lung. Standardized Uptake Values (SUVs) from static imaging (SUVmax) as
well as values of influx rate constant (Ki) of compartmental modeling from dynamic imaging were ob‐
tained. Static and kinetic data from diﬀerent lesions (tumor and inflammations) or diﬀerent locations
(subcutaneous, in situ and spontaneous group) were compared.

Results
Values of SUVmax showed significant diﬀerence in subcutaneous tumor and inflammation (p<0.01),
and in inflammations from diﬀerent locations (p<0.005). However, SUVmax showed no statistical dif‐
ference between in situ tumor and inflammation (p = 1.0) and among tumors from diﬀerent locations
(subcutaneous and in situ, p = 0.91). Values of Ki calculated from compartmental modeling showed
significant diﬀerence between tumor and inflammation both subcutaneously (p<0.005) and orthotopi‐
cally (p<0.01). Ki showed also location specific values for inflammations (subcutaneous, in situ and
spontaneous, p<0.015). However, Ki of tumors from diﬀerent locations (subcutaneous and in situ)
showed no significant diﬀerence (p = 0.46).

Conclusion
In contrast to static PET based SUVmax, both subcutaneous and in situ inflammations and malignan‐
cies can be diﬀerentiated via dynamic FDG-PET based Ki. Moreover, Values of influx rate constant Ki
from compartmental modeling can oﬀer an assessment for inflammations at diﬀerent locations of the
body, which also implies further validation is necessary before the replacement of in situ inflammation
with its subcutaneous counterpart in animal experiments.

Introduction
[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) is one of the most widely
used imaging techniques for detecting and staging tumors, as elevated glucose metabolism is indicative
of malignancies [1]. However, regardless of its high accuracy and sensitivity, high FDG uptake is not
tumor-specific. High level of FDG uptake can also be detected in normal tissues or benign lesions such
as inflammation [2], causing false-positive results and misinterpretation for clinical diagnosis. More‐
over, such false-positive issue is one of the major problems in the clinical staging of non-small cell lung
carcinoma (NSCLC) [3]. Using Lewis Lung Carcinoma (LLC) bearing mice and diﬀerent kinds of in‐
flammatory models, our current study aimed to determine whether certain parameters estimated from
the kinetic modeling approach can serve as a useful and more specific index in diﬀerentiating inflam‐
mations from malignancies in NSCLC, and in diﬀerentiating variation of inflammatory processes.

Tremendous eﬀorts have been reported in the literature to deal with such FDG-PET false-positive issue,
with diﬀerent tracers, such as radiolabeled amino acid O-(2-18F-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (FET) [4], 3'deoxy-3'-(18) F-fluorothymidine (FLT), 11C-choline and 11C-methionine [5]. Compared to FDG, FET’s
uptake by tumor cells is more stereospecific. However, FET’s tumor specific characteristics may diﬀer
from species. Further clinical studies need to determine whether it can be used in patients more com‐
monly in clinical settings [6]. FLT depends on tumor cell proliferation and it is more tumor-specific
than FDG. However, FLT has lower sensitivity, making it diﬃcult to visualize the lesion [7–9]. It also
has high physiological uptake due to increased perfusion and vascular permeability [10]. Therefore, the
use of FLT in place of FDG for staging tumors is not yet feasible. In addition to these 18F labeled trac‐
ers, 11C-choline and 11C-methionine have great limitations due to the short half-life of 11C.
In parallel to introducing new tracers, researchers have also proposed diﬀerent analysis methods to ana‐
lyze FDG-PET data to increase the sensitivity in diﬀerentiating inflammations from malignancies. In
most static FDG-PET studies, Standardized Uptake Value (SUV) is used as a semi-quantitative index in
conjunction with the visual interpretation [11]. As pointed out earlier, SUV doesn’t help in discriminat‐
ing inflammation from tumors, because the intensity of FDG uptake can resemble that of malignancy.
SUV is also influenced by many factors such as the length of uptake period, body composition, partial
volume eﬀects, etc. [12]. And it’s especially not adequate when quantifying uptake in lungs because of
the ineﬀectiveness of SUV correction [13].
The issue of how to avoid false-positive diagnosis in the lungs has been a serious problem encountered
by radiologists for years. The most popular way to diagnose thoracic diseases is still by static PET
imaging, which is diﬃcult to identify changes of FDG uptake in the lung visually, causing misdiagnosis
when it happens to infectious diseases or tumors with low glycolytic activity. Proper interpretation only
happens when an experienced physician is aware of certain conditions [14].
Another semi-quantitative SUV based method was the dual time point imaging procedure. It was shown
that FDG accumulations in some tumors rise with time while uptake in benign lesions decreases [15,
16]. However accumulations in malignancies over time were not observed for all tumors and the inflam‐
matory process seems to be more complicated than a monotonic decreasing function [17].
Absolute PET quantification of physiological parameters via tracer kinetic modeling has been reported
in numerous studies. It uses dynamic PET acquisition consisting of a series of frames over continuous
time intervals. Data from diﬀerent frames are reconstructed to form a set of images independently,
which can be used to estimate physiological parameters [18]. Compared to static and dual time PET
imaging, dynamic PET is expected not only to be more helpful in understanding the pathophysiological
mechanisms of diseases, but also in extracting physiological or biochemical parameters via tracer kinet‐
ics. These parameters are often crucial for interpreting dynamic PET data and to better discriminate
inflammation from malignancies [19].

In spite of the fact that compartmental modeling is the most commonly used method to provide quanti‐
tative information for PET studies, the drawback of this method is the requirement of the plasma Time
Activity Curve (TAC) as the input function for the compartmental model, which is conventionally mea‐
sured by arterial blood sampling [20]. Although blood sampling is considered a gold stand because of
its high accuracy, it provides challenges and additional risks. Subsequent studies have solved the prob‐
lem by introducing noninvasive methods by investigating the use of image-derived input functions [21,
22].
In this study, we performed dynamic PET imaging with the image-derived input function in diﬀerent
mouse models and analyzed both static and dynamic results by obtaining semi-quantitative parameters
(SUVs) and quantitative parameters to determine whether dynamic PET imaging is a better way to dif‐
ferentiate inflammatory lesions from malignancies. Moreover, we compared the kinetics of diﬀerent
locations of the lesions to investigate whether a potential new assessment for tumor or inflammation can
be presented to minimize the misinterpretation during diagnostics.

Materials and Methods
Animal Preparation and Experimental Groups
The protocol for our study was approved by Animal Studies Committee at Shanghai Jiao Tong Univer‐
sity. Experiments were performed on 33 female C57/BL mice (8–10 weeks) weighing 21.1 ± 3.9 g, and
were housed in air-filtered, temperature-controlled units with access to food and water ad libitum. Ani‐
mals were randomly divided into 6 groups: (a) subcutaneous tumor inoculation group (n = 5), (b) in
situ tumor inoculation group (n = 5), (c) subcutaneous inflammation group with tumor (n = 4) (d) sub‐
cutaneous inflammation group without tumor (n = 4), (e) in situ inflammation group (n = 9) and (f)
spontaneous liver inflammation group (n = 6). The specific locations of tumor and inflammation in dif‐
ferent groups are shown in Table 1.

Tumor Model
The experiment was implemented on Lewis Lung Carcinoma (LLC) bearing mice. LLC is a kind of
tumor cell (NSCLC) originated spontaneously as a carcinoma of the lung of a C57/BL mouse. Cells
were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere
containing 5% CO2.
To obtain subcutaneous tumors, 2×106 cultured tumor cells in 50 μL cell suspension were inoculated
under the skin. For in situ tumors, 1×107 tumor cells in 30 μL cell suspension mixed with 20 μL Ma‐
trigel (Promega, USA) were inoculated inside the lung. 2–3 weeks after tumor cell inoculation (subcu‐
taneous tumor volume 319.5 ± 115.1 mm3), animals were sent for PET scan.

Inflammatory Model
The subcutaneous inflammation was induced by inoculation of turpentine oil on the gastrocnemius
muscle of the right leg (0.1 mL). In situ inflammation of lung was implemented by dripping of 50 μL (1
g/L) Lipopolysaccharide (LPS, Sigma Chemical Co, USA) into the trachea. PET scan was carried out 4
days after inoculation. For spontaneous inflammation group, experimental mice were put along with
mice infected by Mice Hepatitis Virus (MHV) to induce spontaneous liver inflammation.

All animals were left fasting overnight the day before acquisition. All animals were anesthetized with
inhalant anesthesia (1%-2% isoflurane in 100% oxygen) using a nose cone. Before acquisition, a 29gauge needle connected to a catheter was placed into the lateral tail vein for FDG tracer administration.
After anesthesia, the animal was placed in a prone position on the platform of the scanner and put in the
center of the field view by laser beam calibration. All data acquisitions were initiated before the tracer
injections. After the scan was started, a bolus of FDG (5.55 ± 0.814 MBq) was injected through the
tail-vein catheter manually, the error caused by the injector and the catheter was calculated by subtract‐
ing the remaining dose. A 60 min dynamic imaging was acquired on a PET scanner (Siemens Inveon)
followed by a 20 min CT scan at 2 bed positions.
The acquired list-mode data were reconstructed with 3-dimensional ordered-subset expectation maxi‐
mization (OSEM) algorithm [23] using the software of Siemens Inveon Acquisition Workplacce with a
framing protocol of 2×1.5 s, 10×0.5 s, 8×5 s, 1×20 s, 1×30s, 1×75s, 1×120s, 1×150 s, 1×400 s, 1×600
s, 1×750s, and 1×900 s.

PET Data Analysis
All the reconstructed data was analyzed using the following steps: Definition of Region of Interest
(ROIs), visual and semi-quantitative analysis of static images via Standardized Uptake Values (SUVs),
Determination of plasma input functions and output functions of diﬀerent lesions, obtaining the influx
rate constant (K i) through compartmental modeling.

Region of Interest Definition
Three-dimensional ellipsoid ROIs were drawn manually over the left ventricle (blood-pool), tumor, in‐
flammatory tissue and liver with a landmark using the software of Siemens Inveon Research Work‐
place. Localization of FDG accumulation of focal tissue was performed visually with the help of the
combination of PET and CT images. For static analysis, the maximum value of SUV within each ROI
was selected as SUVmax. For dynamic analysis, a new ROI was generated automatically to replace the
original one using a region growing method [24] which only included pixels within a range (± 40% of
the average pixel value) to reduce the error.

Plasma Input Function
Since the input function can be retrieved from the image data with good accuracy instead of blood sam‐
pling [25], Time Activity Curve (TAC) of the blood-pool from the left ventricle was extracted as the
image-derived input function.

The input function was calibrated by a time-dependent plasma-to-whole-blood concentration ratio RPB
(t). RPB (t) was defined as
RPB(t) = 0.432e-0.168t + 1.158

(1)

where time t was given in minutes. RPB (t) was previously calculated by Wong et al. through estimating
concentration ratios between plasma and whole-blood samples collected during PET acquisition at dif‐
ferent times t (min) through nonlinear least-squares fitting [26].

Static Analysis
The uptake of FDG on the last frame (at 45–60 min) of dynamic scans was used for static data analysis.
Visual assessment was first performed on static images for determining the right anatomical location of
focal tissues as well as defining ROIs. Tracer accumulation in the ROIs was reported as the Standard‐
ized Uptake Value (SUV)

Kinetic Analysis
TACs were derived from ROIs in the series of reconstructed images. The TAC of the blood-pool and
the Tissue TAC were utilized as the input and output functions to fit a standard three-compartment
model [20] (Fig 1) using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to assess FDG kinetics in tissue [27].

Here Cp(t) is the plasma activity, and Ce(t) and Cm(t) are the concentrations of non-metabolized (free)
and phosphorylated (bound) FDG inside the tissue. K 1, k 2, k 3, k 4 are rate constants. K 1 (mL per sec‐
ond per gram) is the forward rate constant from blood to tissue compartment. k 2 (per second) is the
reverse rate constant between those two compartments, k 3 (per second) shows the phosphorylation rate
of FDG to FDG-6-PO4 by hexokinase, and k 4 (per second) represents the dephosphorylation of FDG6-PO4.
The kinetic of the tracer depicted in Fig 1 is mathematically expressed as in the following equations:

Histologic Examination of Inflamed Tissue and Tumors
After PET data acquisition, animals were sacrificed. For diﬀerent groups, diﬀerent tissues (tumor, lung,
liver and gastrocnemius muscle) were carefully excised from the body. The lung was soaked in 50%
Optimum Cutting Temperature Compound (OCT) for 30 min in advance. The tissues were mold in
OCT cryofixative and frozen in liquid nitrogen for 15 seconds, and then transferred to the -80°C refrig‐
erator for 12 hours. Tissue sections 10 um thick were cut and collected on glass slides. The sections
were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E staining) to visualize
tissue morphology.

Statistical Analysis
With both the semi-quantitative SUV and quantitative K i, we performed statistical analysis. All results
were expressed as mean ± SD. The mean of all interested parameters such as SUVmax and K i in each
study was compared via Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric (KW) test among all the 6 groups. Once the
Kruskal-Wallis non-parameteric test shows significant diﬀerence between the groups in the study, a
post-hoc way multiple pairwise comparisons was conducted on every two subgroups to determine
whether they are statistically diﬀerent [29]. A p-value less than 0.05 were considered statistically signif‐
icant.

Results
I. Histological Results of Animal Models
The image and tissue morphology of tumors are illustrated in Fig 2. From the images (Fig 2A and 2C),
the size and shape of both subcutaneous and in situ tumor are evident. The tissue morphology shows
the pleomorphic and hyperchromatic nuclei as well as regions of increased cell density (Fig 2B and 2D

). For inflammatory lesions in diﬀerent locations, as seen in Fig 3, massive inflammatory infiltration of
neutrophils is seen in and between muscle fibers (Fig 3A), pulmonary tissue (Fig 3B) and liver tissue (
Fig 3C).

The histological results indicate that the animal models of both tumor and inflammation are successful‐
ly built and can be regarded a verification of PET imaging data.

II. Visual Analysis
Examples of visual analysis (in situ tumor and inflammation) are illustrated in Fig 4. From both in situ
tumor and inflammation groups, a high FDG accumulation can be observed inside the lung (Fig 4A, red
arrow and Fig 4B, yellow arrow) with the corresponding SUV value as 1.7. Therefore from the static
data, it is hard to diﬀerentiate inflammatory lesions from malignancies via visual analysis from the PET
image alone.

Examples of visual analysis.
(A) In situ tumor. Red arrow: high FDG uptake caused by tumor inside the lung (value of SUV was around 1.7) (B) In
situ inflammation. Yellow arrow: high FDG uptake caused by inflammation inside the lung (value of SUV was also
around 1.7)

III. Analysis of data from different lesions at the same location of the body
Since no clear diﬀerences were observed from visual analysis alone, results from static analysis (SU‐
Vmax) and kinetic analysis (Ki) of tumor and inflammation at the same location were compared (sub‐
cutaneous and in situ). For subcutaneous lesions, results from both static and kinetic analysis showed
significant diﬀerences. For in situ lesions, no obvious diﬀerence was found between SUVmax values of
tumor and inflammation while Ki values showed statistical diﬀerences.
Static Analysis Fig 5A shows the comparison of SUVmax from 3 subcutaneous groups: tumor, inflam‐
mation with tumor and inflammation without tumor. Inflammation without tumor group had the high‐
est SUVmax (2.32 ± 1.00), followed by tumor (1.66 ± 0.34) and inflammation with tumor (0.78 ±
0.05, Table 2). A significant diﬀerence in SUVmax between three groups was observed (p<0.01).
Among the subcutaneous groups, the FDG uptake of inflammation is much higher without the exis‐
tence of tumor than that of inflammation when both tumor and inflammatory lesions take place.

When it comes to in situ lesions (Fig 5B), mean values SUVmax of inflammation (1.73 ± 0.59) is
slightly higher than that of tumor (1.62 ± 0.25, Table 2). No significant diﬀerence between two groups
was found through KW test (p = 1). The current results from static analysis failed to distinguish in situ
tumor and inflammation.
Kinetic Analysis The result of kinetic analysis for subcutaneous groups is shown in Fig 5C. Similar to
static analysis, values of Ki were highest among inflammation without tumor (mean value 0.001
mL/s/g), followed by tumor (mean value 3.95×10−4 mL/s/g) and inflammation with tumor (mean value
2.49×10−4 mL/s/g, Table 3). Statistical analysis also showed significant diﬀerence between these three
groups (p<0.005). Consistency between static and kinetic analysis for subcutaneous groups indicates
that both static and kinetic analysis can be used to diﬀerentiate subcutaneous tumor and inflammation.

cannot distinguish in situ lesions. As illustrated in Fig 5D, values of Ki from inflammation group (mean
value 0.00112 mL/s/g) were much higher than values from tumor group (mean value 4.38×10−4
mL/s/g, Table 3) (KW test p<0.001).

IV. Analysis of data of the same type of lesion from different locations of the body
In addition to diﬀerent lesions at the same body location, SUVmax and Ki values of tumors or inflam‐
mations from diﬀerent body locations were compared. Results from static and kinetic analysis are gen‐
erally similar. For tumors, values from diﬀerent locations showed no significant diﬀerences. For inflam‐
matory lesions, diﬀerences were found in all four groups according to KW test.
Static Analysis For tumors from diﬀerent locations of the body (Fig 6A), values of SUVmax showed
no obvious diﬀerence (p = 0.91) between subcutaneous groups (1.66 ± 0.34) and in situ groups (1.62 ±
0.25, Table 2). However, diﬀerences of these two groups can be observed from TAC visually (Fig 7).

As for inflammation located in diﬀerent parts of the body, it is shown in Fig 6B that SUVmax values of
inflammation were highest among subcutaneous groups without tumor (2.32 ± 1.00), followed by in
situ inflammation (1.73 ± 0.59), spontaneous inflammation (1.40 ± 0.32) and subcutaneous inflamma‐
tion with tumor (0.78 ± 0.05, Table 2). Significant statistical diﬀerence were found in these four groups
through KW test (p<0.005). Each two-group pair was compared by the multiple pairwise comparisons
after KW test [29]. The subcutaneous inflammation with tumor group showed significant diﬀerence
with the situ inflammation (p = 0.03) and subcutaneous inflammation without tumor (p = 0.002). How‐
ever, there was no significant diﬀerence between inflammation without tumor, in situ inflammation and
spontaneous inflammation.
Kinetic Analysis In accord with static data, there were no significant diﬀerence of Ki values (p = 0.46,
Fig 6C) between subcutaneous (mean value 3.95×10−4 mL/s/g) and in situ tumor groups (mean value
4.38×10−4 mL/s/g, Table 3). Therefore, from our current results, tumors from diﬀerent body locations
cannot be diﬀerentiated. However, the shapes of TACs from subcutaneous and in situ groups are quite
diﬀerent from each other (Fig 7).
Fig 6D shows the result of kinetic analysis from inflammation among diﬀerent body locations. Sponta‐
neous inflammation has the highest Ki values (mean value 0.033 mL/s/g), followed by in situ inflamma‐
tion (mean value 0.00112) and subcutaneous inflammation without tumor (mean value 0.00108) respec‐

tively. Same as static results, subcutaneous inflammation with tumor has lowest mean Ki value of
2.49×10−4 mL/s/g (Table 3). For statistical analysis, all four groups showed significant diﬀerence as a
whole according to KW test (p = 0.01). Statistical results from the multiple pairwise comparisons after
KW test presented that the subcutaneous inflammation with tumor has the lowest Ki values than the
spontaneous inflammation with p = 0.011 [29]. Other three groups showed no significant diﬀerences
between each other.

Discussion
In this study, we examined the hypothesized higher sensitivity of the tracer kinetic modeling approach
in diﬀerentiating in situ inflammation and tumor. Indeed, we found that, while SUVmax failed to detect
any diﬀerence between in situ inflammation and tumor, the Ki values succeeded in doing so.
It is reported that, in inflammatory lesions in lungs, Ki is closely related to neutrophil activation with
pulmonary sequestration or infiltration and that the correlation of SUV and Ki was low [30]. Consis‐
tently, we also found weak correlation of SUV and Ki when comparing in situ tumor with inflammation
(R2 = 0.05, p = 0.718 and R2 = 0.007, p = 0.831, respectively), which was in contrast to the relatively
higher correlation between these two measurements when assessing subcutaneous groups or inflamma‐
tory lesions in diﬀerent locations of the body. Thus, quantifying absolute FDG uptake, instead of the
semi-quantification, in lungs is more adequate and sensitive.
In our study, inflammatory lesions from diﬀerent parts of the body presented high values of SUVmax
and Ki. The reason of high FDG uptake for inflammatory lesions is that inflammatory cells such as
macrophages and neutrophils had the elevated expression of glucose transporters (GLUTs) such as
GLUT-1 and GLUT-3 [31]. Besides that, Cytokines and growth factors played important roles in pro‐
moting the aﬃnity of glucose transporters for deoxyglucose. This kind of phenomenon has not been
seen in tumors [17, 32]. We found that inflammation in diﬀerent situation has diﬀerent kind of FDG
uptake. Assessing the kinetics of inflammations from diﬀerent part of the body might help establishing
a new way to evaluate inflammation.
Based on the result of the data, the uptake of inflammation appeared to be the highest without the exis‐
tence of tumor. However, co-existence of inflammation and tumor caused a significant reduction of the
uptake of inflammatory lesions, which was far lower than tumor uptake alone. Mochizuki et al. found
that both tumor and inflammatory lesions expressed more GLUT-1 and GLUT-3, which is the main
cause of high FDG uptake in tumor and inflammatory lesions. Their study also discovered that the level
of GLUT-1 expression in tumor was significantly higher than that in inflammation [33]. Mamede et al.
studied how inflammation aﬀects the FDG uptake in tumor tissues as a whole. They found that the con‐
tribution of inflammation to the overall FDG uptake in NSCLC is not significant, and hypothesized that
inflammatory cells take FDG not using only the expression of GLUT-1, but using the expression of oth‐

er glucose transporters or hexokinases [34]. The mechanisms of FDG accumulation in inflammations
still remain unclear. Based on their results, we supposed the high expression of GLUT-1 in tumor cells
may reduce GLUT-1 expression of inflammatory cells, when tumor and inflammation co-exist. There‐
fore, the FDG uptake will be reduced. Apparently our current study was not designed to understand the
mechanism of this observation and additional study is needed for such examination.
When it comes to tumor in diﬀerent parts of the body, usually tumors were planted subcutaneously in
mice for convenience, low cost and reproducibility. However, recent studies have shown that orthotopic
location of tumor may be more capable of imitating the real-life situation [35]. In our current studies,
although we were not able to diﬀerentiate tumors in diﬀerent locations according to values of SUVmax
or Ki, subcutaneous and in situ tumors showed huge diﬀerence in time activity curve. The FDG uptake
of in situ tumors showed high initial activity with a downward trend, while subcutaneous tumor showed
gradual accumulation of FDG. The activities of both subcutaneous and in situ tumor end up at almost
the same level. Graves et al. reported that although both in situ and subcutaneous tumor may share ele‐
vated metabolism and glycolytic activity based on the result of FDG-PET, subcutaneous tumors showed
significant hypoxia while in situ tumors were well-oxygenated and the dynamic range remained un‐
known [36]. The diﬀerence of hypoxia might be one of cause for diﬀerences in time activity from tu‐
mors in diﬀerent locations. For diﬀerent inflammations, our results showed significant diﬀerence be‐
tween inflammations in diﬀerent body locations, which indicates that in situ inflammation models can‐
not be replaced by subcutaneous ones regardless of its easy procedures.
In FDG compartment modeling, when the dephosphorilization is so slow that the tracer uptake is irre‐
versible, the rate constant k4 can be assumed to be zero [20]. For FDG undergoing irreversible trapping,
the analyzing method can also be simplified using the Patlak graphical analysis [37]. However, we ob‐
served significant non-zero k4 in our work during experimental time for all animals (p = 0.0018). In
inflammatory cell, the levels of glucose-6-phosphatase are higher than that in malignant cells in a previ‐
ous study which discussed the malignant and inflammatory process diﬀerences [15]. In our work, the
dephosphorilation rate (k4) in situ inflammation group is almost significantly higher than that in tumor
group (p = 0.0532) with even the small number of samples used in our study. In the subcutaneous
groups (subcutaneous inflammation with tumor, subcutaneous inflammation without tumor and subcu‐
taneous tumor), the dephosphorilation rate (k4) is significantly diﬀerent (p = 0.0395). For each sub‐
group, k4 in subcutaneous inflammation without tumor is significant higher than that of subcutaneous
inflammation with tumor (p = 0.0209). Based on our data analysis, the dephosphorilation rate (k4) is
non-ignorable to simplify the model most likely due to the inclusion of the inflammation animals.
There were limitations in our current study. The major one is the small sample size. We attempted to
address this issue by using the non-parametric tests. Future studies with larger sample sizes are needed
to confirm our findings. Secondly, our data acquisition was long for small animals and also not practical

for clinical settings. We will evaluate the use of shorter scan for adequately distinguishing inflammation
from tumors. Thirdly, the mouse model we used (LLC) is one type of NSCLC model. Therefore, the
results might not be applicable in the situation of Small Cell Lung Carcinoma (SCLC).

Conclusions
Dynamic FDG-PET imaging is more sensitive to quantify FDG uptake in orthotopic lesions and to dif‐
ferentiate in situ malignancies from inflammations than static analysis for NSCLC. And comparison of
influx rate constant Ki can be a metric to assess inflammations at diﬀerent part of the body.

Edge density based automatic detection of inflammation in colonoscopy videos - ScienceDirect

2/19/24, 11:07 AM

Colon cancer is one of the deadliest diseases where early detection can prolong life and can increase the
survival rates. The early stage disease is typically associated with polyps and mucosa inflammation. The
often used diagnostic tools rely on high quality videos obtained from colonoscopy or capsule endoscope.
The state-of-the-art image processing techniques of video analysis for automatic detection of anomalies use
statistical and neural network methods. In this paper, we investigated a simple alternative model-based
approach using texture analysis. The method can easily be implemented in parallel processing mode for
real-time applications. A characteristic texture of inflamed tissue is used to distinguish between
inflammatory and healthy tissues, where an appropriate filter kernel was proposed and implemented to
efficiently detect this specific texture. The basic method is further improved to eliminate the effect of blood
vessels present in the lower part of the descending colon. Both approaches of the proposed method were
described in detail and tested in two different computer experiments. Our results show that the
inflammatory region can be detected in real-time with an accuracy of over 84%. Furthermore, the
experimental study showed that it is possible to detect certain segments of video frames containing
inflammations with the detection accuracy above 90%.

Introduction
Colon cancer is recognized as one of the most common malignant diseases, thus regular examination of
colon gains importance, especially for high risk populations [1]. Prevention of colon cancer is related to the
detection of polyps, since untreated polyps can develop into cancer [2]. Inflammatory bowel diseases (most
commonly Crohns disease and ulcerative colitis) are chronic diseases that include inflammation in the
gastrointestinal tract. Early stage detection of inflammatory diseases is very important as it allows the
patient to be provided with dietary advice and precaution. Polyps and inflammation can be detected during
various medical procedures which include analysis of high-length videos, implying the necessity of
computer-aided diagnostics of the gastrointestinal tract and its discussion within the scientific community.
The most effective colon screening method is colonoscopy, which is a bowel examination procedure that
uses a camera and a flexible tube. Colonoscopy provides high resolution video, suitable for easy visual
detection of pathological inflammation and colon diseases. Although colonoscopy can provide high quality
videos and efficient ways to visually detect anomalies and ability to collect tissue samples in vivo, it is
invasive and often uncomfortable [3] and gives view to colon only. One alternative medical approach for
examination of the digestive tract is the so-called virtual colonoscopy, which includes the analysis of
computer tomography (CT) scans. This method irradiates the patient. In the last decade, capsule endoscopy
(CE) treatment has gained popularity. It is a minimally invasive screening approach which allows viewing
the complete digestive tract without sedation, radiation or air-inflation. Capsule endoscopy uses a smart pill
equipped with a camera and a radio transmitter that sends images to a recorder attached to the patient's
waist. Smart pill can record over an eight hour long period, providing thousands of images. An overview and
manual annotation of the complete dataset from one examination is time consuming. It would be helpful to

automatically select images showing anomalies, such as internal bleeding, polyps and inflammation. If a
physician is focused on images with higher priority, diagnosis requires less time. The main advantage of CE
is the possibility of image acquisition throughout the whole digestive tract.
Even though physicians are able to observe live video during the colonoscopy examination, during which
visual overview is usually sufficient to detect anomalies, additional real-time processing may be helpful for
pinpointing the exact location of anomalies and faster visual detection. Another motivation for real-time
processing of colonoscopy videos can be supported by the study showing that accuracy of real-time optical
small polyp (less than 1 cm) detection made by gastroenterologists, is approximately 76% [4]. Therefore,
real-time processing of high definition video can be useful to provide the gastroenterologist with a decision
making tool to improve the human performance. Nevertheless, it is hard to implement real-time processing,
especially if complex algorithms need to be included. On the other hand, parallel implementation can
provide fast processing and less time consumption.
Two main starting goals of this research were enabling fast video processing and achieving a high detection
rate of inflammatory tissue. The algorithm proposed in this paper relies on neither computationally
expensive feature extraction nor statistical learning. We took advantage of new technological developments
in video acquisition, which can provide high quality video data. We used videos obtained by the Olympus
probe [5] which delivers images with increased brightness and contrast, enabling close mucosal
observation. The probe has an optical system with depth of field from 2 to 100 mm. Observing from closer
distance can reveal fine texture of mucous when it is either healthy or inflamed. The first contribution of
this research is a proposal of a simple and fast texture analysis based on edge density estimation, which is
used for automatic inflammation detection. The second contribution is the fact that parallel implementation
of the proposed algorithm based on General Purpose computing on Graphics Processing Units (GPGPU)

Used data
We used three colonoscopy videos with different durations and with a frame resolution of 768×576 pixels
and a frame rate of 25 fps, all of which were obtained using the Olympus probe. This video footage contains
segments showing pathological inflammation and segments with healthy tissue, including upper and lower

Since real-time processing of high-resolution colonoscopy video is the primary goal of the research, the
detection algorithm must be optimized for fast execution. This implies simplicity in design which often
implies a high error rate, or high degree of parallelism. Since processing is meant to be integrated with a
portable device, the hardware could be constrained in terms of size and power usage which implies limited
parallelism. A simplified parallel approach combining high performance and…

Abstract
Cell survival or death is one critical issue in inflammatory responses. Ferroptosis, which is characterized by
iron-dependent lethal lipid peroxidation, has been found to participate in the development of cancers,
degenerative brain diseases and ischemia-reperfusion injuries. Incorporation of polyunsaturated fatty acids
(PUFAs) into cellular membranes represents a vulnerability to invasion of microbials and sterile stimuli. In
addition, the competition for iron in the battle between microbials and host cells underlies infection
development. Although host cells have been equipped with complex antioxidant systems to combat lethal
accumulation of lipid peroxidation, emerging evidence suggests several pathogens may target PUFAs in the
cell membrane, and manipulate ferroptosis as a way for pathogen propagation. Moreover, ferroptosis takes
part in the progression of sterile inflammations, such as cigarette smoke-induced chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, stroke and ischemia-reperfusion injuries. As iron-dependent oxidative stress and lipid
peroxidation are common features for ferroptosis and inflammatory diseases, underlying mechanisms
linking such pathological conditions will be discussed in this review. Progress in the research of ferroptosis
may shed more light on the etiology and treatment of inflammatory diseases.

1. Introduction
As said by Lao Tzu, an ancient Chinese philosopher, life and death are one thread, the same line viewed from
different sides. In response to various microbial components, chemical or physical stimuli, the innate
immune system may respond by survival or cell death depending on the specific cue from the stimuli
(Bolívar et al., 2019). By production of various chemokines, cytokines as well as growth factors,
inflammatory responses may recruit defense cells, including neutrophils, monocytes and macrophages, to
clear stimuli and facilitate the survival of host cells. Previously, dying cells were thought to be removed
rapidly by circulating phagocytes with very limited significance in the progress of inflammation. However,
diverse molecules released from the cytoplasm into the extracellular environment during cell death may
profoundly affect their cellular environment and act as danger signals to further recruit defense cells (Fuchs
and Steller, 2015). Therefore, cell death is not only a consequence of inflammation, but also a dynamic
process that is tightly integrated into the development and progression of inflammatory diseases. Indeed, it
has been shown that multiple regulated cell deaths, such as apoptosis, pyroptosis, necroptosis, autosis and
NETosis, are involved in the development of infection and sterile inflammation (Vasilikos et al., 2017;
Weinlich et al., 2017).
The term ferroptosis was coined in 2012 by Dixon et al. to describe the form of cell death induced by the
small molecule erastin (Dixon et al., 2012). As a specific inducer of ferroptosis, erastin may inhibit cystineglutamate antiporter system Xc−, blocking transportation of cystine into cytoplasm. Failure to reduce
excessive intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to depletion of the antioxidant glutathione may
lead to lethal lipid peroxidation in the cell membrane (Yang et al., 2014). This unique cell death is
characterized by iron-dependent ROS and oxidized lipid contents in the cell membrane. Cell death induced
by specific inducers of ferroptosis can be suppressed by deferoxamine and deferiprone to chelate
intracellular iron content, and inhibited by ferrostatins and liproxstatins to reduce lipid peroxidation
(Stockwell et al., 2017). Several other key molecules also participated in the progress of ferroptosis, such as
acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4), which enrich cellular membranes with long
polyunsaturated ω6 fatty acids (Doll et al., 2017), and glutathione peroxidase 4 (Gpx4), which reduces lipid
peroxides in the cell membrane by reduced glutathione (Friedmann Angeli et al., 2014).
The physiological role of ferroptosis has been rarely explored. Continuous severe cold stress induces
ferroptosis in multiple cell lines; therefore, ferroptosis may be present to maintain tissue homeostasis in a
normal physiological environment (Hattori et al., 2017). Existing literatures support an important role of
ferroptosis in the progress of tumor (Yang et al., 2014), ischemia-reperfusion injury (Li et al., 2019a, Li et al.,
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079610720300250?via%3Dihub

2019) as well as degenerative neurological diseases, including Alzheimer’s, Huntington’s, and Parkinson’s
diseases (Do Van et al., 2016; Abdalkader et al., 2018). Although ROS is critical for the immune defense
system to combat inflammatory stimuli, redundant ROS may cause excessive oxidative stress and deplete
intracellular anti-oxidants, leading to excessive lipid peroxidation (Toufekoula et al., 2013; Kang et al., 2018).
Indeed, ferroptosis has been shown to play roles in the pathogenesis of several types of microbial infections
(Dar et al., 2018; Amaral et al., 2019) and sterile inflammation such as ischemia-perfusion injury and stroke
(Guo et al., 2008; Yigitkanli et al., 2013; Tuo et al., 2017; Karuppagounder et al., 2018). The possible
mechanism of ferroptosis development and its role in inflammatory diseases will be discussed in this
review.

2. Defining ferroptosis
The complexity of regulated cell death (RCD) must be stressed before defining decisive features for
ferroptosis. Different types of RCD are actually intertwined and mediated by a cascade of inter-correlated
genes. For example, the state of caspase-8 determines whether a specific cell undergoes survival, apoptosis
or necroptosis, and receptor interacting protein kinase 1 can interact with caspase-8 to induce apoptosis
while coordinate with receptor interacting protein kinase 3 and mixed lineage kinase domain like
pseudokinase to activate necroptosis (Weinlich et al., 2017). In contrast to the characteristic condensation
and fragmentation of nuclei as well as fragmentation of chromosomal DNA in the apoptosis, defining other
RCDs is hardly possible by ultrastructural changes. Employing antibodies to phosphorylated mixed lineage
kinase domain-like protein facilitates specific detection of necroptosis, while utilizing antibodies to
gasdermin protein helps determine pyroptosis and detection of cleaved caspase-3 contributes to ascertain
apoptotic cells (Tonnus et al., 2019). Defining ferroptosis by certain decisive molecules has not been
successful until now. However, several key biological features underlie the development of ferroptosis.
Ultrastructural morphological changes with vanished mitochondria cristae, condensed as well as ruptured
mitochondrial membranes can be commonly found in the ferroptosis (Mou et al., 2019), whereas nuclear
condensation or chromatin margination, which are key characteristics of apoptosis, are not observed in
erastin-treated cancer cells (Dixon et al., 2012). In addition, ferroptosis is accompanied by excessive irondependent ROS accumulation, which depletes cellular glutathione (GSH). Failure in the intracellular redox
system may lead to accumulation of lipid peroxidation products, the key events in the development of
ferroptosis. Ferroptosis can be pharmacologically induced by several chemicals like erastin to block System
Xc− and RSL3 to inhibit Gpx4. System Xc− is an amino acid antiporter in the cellular plasma membrane
mediating import of extracellular cystine into cytoplasm and export of intracellular glutamate into
extracellular space (Dixon et al., 2012), while Gpx4 is a selenium-containing enzyme that protects cells
against oxidative damage by reducing lipid peroxides in the cell membrane by reduced GSH(Seiler et al.,
2008). Ferroptotic cell death can be checked by several strategies: utilizing iron chelators, such as
deferoxamine and desferrioxamine mesylate, to alleviate intracellular iron content, using ferrostatin and
liproxstatin to lessen lipid peroxidation level (Dixon et al., 2012; Friedmann Angeli et al., 2014) and function

as radical-trapping antioxidants (RTAs) (Zilka et al., 2017), utilizing zileuton, one of LOX inhibitors, to exhibit
effective radical-trapping activity and protect lipids from autoxidation (Liu et al., 2015; Shah et al., 2018) and
employing lipophilic antioxidant vitamin E to reduce oxidative stress (Xie et al., 2016).

3. Glutathione metabolism in ferroptosis and inflammation
The intricate balance between the ROS and the antioxidant system maintains homeostasis of host cells to
remove danger stimuli and contain detrimental oxidative stress. The cystine-glutamate antiporter system
Xc−, which consists of SLC3A2 and SLC7A11, regulates intracellular glutathione to balance redundant
hydroxyl peroxides (Dixon et al., 2012). In normal physiologic conditions, System Xc− antiporter imports
extracellular cystine into the cytoplasm, while exports intracellular glutamate into extracellular space to
maintain normal cell function. All available intracellular cystine can be converted into cysteine, which can
be further transformed into reduced GSH in two steps by the ATP-dependent cytosolic enzymes glutamatecysteine ligase and glutathione synthetase (Zhu et al., 2019).
GSH plays a crucial role in maintaining the intracellular redox balance, as it can be utilized by Gpx4 as a
cofactor to eliminate membrane lipid peroxides and reduce oxidative stress (Seiler et al., 2008). In normal
physiological context, Gpx4 achieved its peroxidase action by using the reduced form of GSH as an electron
donor. Gpx4 may convert potentially toxic lipid hydroperoxides (L-OOH) to non-toxic lipid alcohols (L-OH)
in the cell membrane (Fig. 1). Systemic Gpx4 knockout in mice leads to embryonic lethality, which may be
correlated with mass neuronal cell loss in the nervous system (Ran et al., 2004); while increased cell death
with enhanced lipid peroxidation was observed in conditional Gpx4 knockout models (Seiler et al., 2008;
Yoo et al., 2012; Sengupta et al., 2013; Friedmann Angeli et al., 2014). Although the cell death was defined as
apoptosis in these animal models, it is highly likely that ferroptosis occurred under such circumstances
(Yang et al., 2014).

cytoplasm while it pumps intracellular glutamate into the extracellular space. Cystine can be further
sequentially transformed into cysteine and glutathione. Gpx4 utilizes glutathione to reduce the elevated
ROS in cells. Excessive lipid peroxidation can lead to ferroptosis of host cells. Several chemical agents can be
utilized to induce ferroptosis, such as erastin and sorafenib that target System Xc−, and RSL3, DPI12 as well
as ML162 that blocks Gpx4.

Extracellular cystine deprivation, excessive accumulation of extracellular glutamate, malfunctioned
antiporter System Xc−, depletion of intracellular GSH and Gpx4 inactivation all contribute to onset of
ferroptosis. Multiple agents have been utilized to elicit ferroptosis by targeting System Xc−, GSH and Gpx4
(Stockwell et al., 2017). Erastin and its analogs (Dixon et al., 2012), sulfasalazine (Xie et al., 2016), glutamate,
and sorafenib (Louandre et al., 2013) may inhibit System Xc-to induce ferroptosis. Disruption of System Xc−
by erastin may not only deplete intracellular cysteine and GSH, but also induce autophagy, especially
nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4)-mediated ferritinophagy, which release ferritin-bound iron into the
cytosol. Knockout or knockdown of autophagy related 5 (Atg5) and Atg7 reduced erastin-induced
ferroptosis with decreased intracellular ferrous iron levels and lessened lipid peroxidation (Hou et al., 2016).
RSL3 and ML162 may block Gpx4 (Yang et al., 2014) while FIN56 depletes Gpx4 protein (Shimada et al.,
2016). FINO2 can stimulate lipid peroxidation and indirectly inhibit Gpx4 activity (Gaschler et al., 2018),
while cystine/cysteine deprivation, BSO, DPI12, cisplatin can deplete GSH to activate ferroptosis (Yang et al.,
2014; Roh et al., 2016).
ROS and oxidative stress are common features accompanying inflammation. Deficient cytoplasmal GSH may
cripple the activation of mammalian target of rapamycin-1, NFAT as well as Myc, thereby compromising
sufficient energy production and damaging Myc-dependent metabolic reprogramming (Mak et al., 2017).
Therefore, GSH deficiency may lead to a failure in the switch from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis
and disrupt glutaminolysis under pathologic stimuli. Moreover, T-cell-specific ablation of murine glutamate
cysteine ligase cripples antiviral defenses, but helps lessen autoimmune diseases (Mak et al., 2017). In
addition, Gpx4 expression participates in the pathogenesis of Hepatitis C virus (HCV)-induced hepatitis.
Gpx4-silencing reduces the specific infectivity of HCV by up to 10-fold (Brault et al., 2016). By alleviating
ROS level, Gpx4 activation intricately lessens damages in inflammatory conditions by regulating activation
of NF-κB and oxidation of arachidonic acid (Brigelius-Flohé, 2006). Therefore, the perturbation in the
system Xc−-Gpx4-GSH axis may predispose the infected or inflamed cells to the onset of ferroptosis in
certain circumstances.
In addition to the canonical glutathione-based GPX4 pathway, FSP1-CoQ10-NAD(P)H pathway functions as a
stand-alone parallel system, which cooperates with GPX4 and glutathione to suppress phospholipid
peroxidation and ferroptosis. The ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1) (previously known as apoptosisinducing factor mitochondrial 2 (AIFM2)) reduces coenzyme Q10 (CoQ) as an oxidoreductase using
NAD(P)H, trapping excessive radicals and impeding the exorbitance of lipid peroxides (Bersuker et al., 2019;
Doll et al., 2019).

4. Iron in ferroptosis and inflammation
Iron-dependent lipid peroxidation is one key characteristic in the development of ferroptosis. Several
chemicals, including 2,2-bipyridyl, deferoxamine as well as ciclopirox, can protect cells from erastin- and
RSL3-induced ferroptosis by chelating intracellular iron (Dixon et al., 2012). On the contrary, addition of
bioavailable forms of iron, such as ferric ammonium citrate, ferric citrate, iron chloride hexahydrate as well
as transferrin-bound iron, may sensitize cells into development of ferroptosis when treated with erastin
(Gao et al., 2015).
The metal iron is crucial for the development of ferroptosis, because iron may generate ROS by Fenton
reaction in both physiological and pathological conditions (Schaible and Kaufmann, 2004). In the circulation
system, iron is transported to vertebrate cells in the form of ferric iron (Fe3+) by the transferrin protein, and
iron is vitally important for maintaining normal cell function. Transferrin can be recognized by transferrin
receptors (TFRs) on the cell membrane and transferred into intracellular endosomes (DeGregorioRocasolano et al., 2019). In the acidic environment of endosome, Fe3+ is dissociated from the transferrin–
receptor complex and further transformed into ferrous iron (Fe2+) by the reductase STEAP3. Following the
reduction process, Fe2+ is further transferred into the labile iron pool (LIP) in the cytoplasm by SLC11A2. This
low-molecular-weight pool of weakly chelated Fe2+ and Fe3+ can rapidly passes through the cell, catalyzing
formation of highly damaging hydroxyl radical through the Fenton reaction (Robello et al., 2009). Despite its
redox-active nature, LIP represents only a minor fraction (5%) of the total cell iron (50–100 µM) in quiescent
conditions, while the major iron is stored in the ferritin (Kakhlon and Cabantchik, 2002). In normal
conditions, intracellular iron can be efficiently pumped into extracellular space by ferroportin, a protein in
the cell membrane. Then the exported Fe2+ can be oxidized into Fe3+ by ferroportin-associated
ceruloplasmin, a copper-containing ferroxidase with homology to the intestine-specific enzyme hephaestin
(Fig. 2). In addition to donating electrons to oxygen to generate ROS and lipid peroxides, which is also called
autoxidation, iron is also indispensable for the enzyme-mediated peroxidation process by lipoxygenases
(Shah et al., 2018). The reactivity of lipoxygenase (LOX) depends on its active site structure around a
mononuclear, non-heme iron center (Gaffney et al., 1993). LOX catalyzes oxidation of PUFAs to their
hydroperoxyl intermediates, including hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid, in the case of arachidonic acid
(Shintoku et al., 2017). It must be noted that although LOX activity may contribute to the cellular pool of
lipid hydroperoxides that initiate ferroptosis, spontaneous peroxyl radical-mediated lipid peroxidation
(autoxidation) may play a critical role in driving ferroptosis (Shah et al., 2018).

Fig. 2. Iron metabolism in ferroptosis. Ferroportin and transferrin receptor (TFR) maintains iron
homeostasis by pumping Fe2+ and Fe3+ into extracellular space and into cytoplasm respectively. Fe3+ was
transferred into the endosome by TFR-transferrin complexes, and Fe3+ is reduced to Fe2+ by STEAP3 in the
endosome, then Fe2+ is released into a labile iron pool. Fe2+ that is exported into the extracellular space can
be oxidized by ceruloplasmin into Fe3+, which can be taken up by transferrin. Fe2+ is crucial in the
development of ferroptosis by oxidizing lipids in the cell membrane through Fenton reaction and catalyzing
lipid peroxidation through lipoxygenases (LOXs). Lipid peroxidation is the key events in ferroptosis. LPCAT3
and ACSL4 also participate in the pathogenesis of ferroptosis by regulating polyunsaturated fatty acid
(PUFA) metabolism.

Being an integral part of the innate antimicrobial defense, iron catalyzes the generation of reactive oxygen
species (ROS) to clear stimuli. In the progress of inflammation, iron homeostasis may be disrupted,
generating excessive ROS which results in detrimental effects in cells and tissues. To gain irons that are
indispensable for cell survival, competition for iron underlies the battle between vertebrate cells and
microbials. In response to lipopolysaccharide and lipoteichoic acid, levels of intracellular iron content are
increased in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells and BV-2 microglia, leading to iron accumulation in neurological
tissues (Pandur et al., 2018). In addition, by chelating intracellular iron content, DIBI reduces excessive
inflammatory responses and improve outcome in an experimental endotoxemia model (Thorburn et al.,
2017). Increased iron levels in the cytoplasm can also be observed in macrophages in the infection process
of Bacteroides fragilis, a commensal bacterium in the intestine (Verma et al., 2019). Such iron accumulation
may be closely related to downregulated ferroportin in macrophages, and the effects of the iron chelator
deferoxamine were compromised in Salmonella-induced IL-6 and IL-1β production (Verma et al., 2019).
Therefore, disruption in the iron metabolism in the infection and sterile inflammation underlies the
development of inflammatory diseases. Whether such disturbance would predispose cells to oxidative
stress or ferroptosis in particular regions is still to be clarified.

5. ROS and lipid peroxidation in the ferroptosis and inflammation
ROS plays multiple roles in physiological and pathological conditions, mainly including three groups of
oxygen-containing molecules: superoxide (O2•-), peroxides (H2O2 and ROOH) and free radicals (HO• and
RO•) (Spooner and Yilmaz, 2011). ROS is generated as a natural byproduct of oxidative phosphorylation by
the electron transfer system in the mitochondria to reduce oxygen. In addition, ROS can be produced by
NADPH oxidases. ROS is of critical importance for neutrophils and monocytes to clear pathogens, including
bacteria, fungi and viruses, by respiratory burst. Moreover, ROS can act as intracellular signaling molecules,
mediating inflammation, apoptosis and pyroptosis in multiple cells (Latunde-Dada, 2017). Excessive ROS
production may cause cellular oxidative stress, and damage DNA, proteins as well as lipids.
In addition to intracellular iron accumulation, disrupted lipid metabolism underlies the onset of ferroptosis.
Phospholipids are major components in the cell membrane to its fluidity. Polyunsaturated fatty acids
(PUFAs) within phospholipids such as phosphatidylcholine, including arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic
acid, may mediate intracellular signal transduction, and they are most susceptible to undergo peroxidation
in the course of ferroptosis (Yang et al., 2016). When the iron-dependent ROS is exorbitantly elevated,
redundant peroxidation of PUFAs occurs, leading to malfunctioned cell membrane and propelling cells
toward iron-dependent cell death (Doll et al., 2017). Cyclooxygenases, cytochrome p450 as well as
lipoxygenases are the three most characterized types of lipid oxidation enzymes; however, it has been
demonstrated that lipoxygenases rather than cyclooxygenases participated in erastin-mediated ferroptosis
(Yang et al., 2016). In the course of ferroptosis, 15-lipoxygenase-1 translocates to cell membrane and
interacts with PUFAs to induce ferroptosis; moreover, siRNA-mediated silencing of ALOX15 and several
inhibitors of lipoxygenases can block erastin-and RSL3-induced cell death in cancer cells (Shintoku et al.,
2017).
In addition to lipid peroxidases, several genes that regulate synthesis of PUFA and maintain integrity of the
normal cell membrane may also impact ferroptosis development. Presently, it has been shown that
lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3 (LPCAT3) and ACSL4, which are responsible for insertion of the
unsaturated arachidonic acid into phosphatidylethanolamine in the cellular phospholipid membrane, fuels
ferroptotic cell death and aggravates erastin- and RSL3-induced ferroptosis in cancer cells (Shintoku et al.,
2017).
Lipid peroxidation can be observed in multiple physiological conditions, such as cellular apoptosis and
inflammatory processes (Dixon et al., 2012). Lipid peroxidation is one key feature in atherosclerotic plaques
progression. Oxidized low density lipoprotein may trigger sterile inflammation in macrophages and
formation of foam cells, and it is well recognized as the culprit in hyperlipidemic atherosclerosis progress.
Moreover, lipid peroxidation has long been reported to participated in the pathogenesis of bacteria, viruses
and fungi infection (Martynenko et al., 1990; Deighton et al., 1999; Toufekoula et al., 2013). More
specifically, elevated membrane lipid peroxidation can be observed in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in response to
TCR ligation during infection progress; the crucial selenoenzyme Gpx4 may scavenge excessive ROS and

reduce phospholipid hydroperoxides, thereby maintaining immunological homeostasis by regulating
survival and expansion of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (Matsushita et al., 2015). Moreover, Gpx4 deficiency is
closely correlated with gasdermin D-mediated pyroptosis in lethal polymicrobial sepsis. Conditional Gpx4
knockout in myeloid lineage cells propels lipid peroxidation, caspase-11 activation and gasdermin D
cleavage, promoting rupture of the cell membrane and release of danger associated molecule pattern such
as high mobility group box 1, alarmin and pro-IL-1β(Kang et al., 2018). Therefore, lipid peroxidation may
bridge the pathological process of ferroptosis and microbial infection. Multiple agents have been utilized to
block lipid peroxidation, such as ferrostatins, liproxstatins, deuterated polyunsaturated fatty acids, CoQ10,
vitamin E, alpha-tocopherol and Trolox. Whether such agents can lessen inflammatory responses in
inflammation should be further explored.

6. Ferroptosis in the infection
In response to invasion of microbials, host cells utilize a wide array of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs),
including Toll like receptors (TLRs), C-type lectin receptors and RIG-1 like receptors, to identify pathogenassociated molecular patterns (PAMPs), such as lipoteichoic acid, peptidoglycan and lipopolysaccharide
(LPS). Following ligation of PRRs with PAMPs, the danger signals are transmitted into the nucleus, initiating
a cascade of cellular events, including production of cytokines, chemokines and ROS. Profuse generation of
ROS is vital for clearing toxic stimuli while excessive ROS may cause oxidative stress and tissue damages in
infection-related diseases in both experimental animals and human subjects (Atabay et al., 2017). Two of
the best defined sources of ROS during host cell-microbe interactions are the membrane associated NADPH
oxidase complex and mitochondrial electron transport chain with the latter one being the primary source of
ROS (Spooner and Yilmaz, 2011). For example, lipopolysaccharide from P. gingivalis, one major putative
pathogen for chronic periodontitis, may elicit mitochondrial dysfunction, high ROS production and oxidative
stress (Bullon et al., 2011). Typical mitochondrial dysfunction is characterized by decreased mitochondrial
protein, mitigated mitochondrial mass and reduced membrane potential. Except for its profound roles in
inflammation, apoptosis and pyroptosis, prolonged elevation in ROS levels in tissues may also deplete the
anti-oxidant pool in the cystine-GSH-Gpx4 pathway (Zhu et al., 2019).
Phospholipids in the cell membrane stands at the first line of defense against the microbial stimuli by
maintaining homeostasis of host cells. Microbials with the capability to produce lipoxygenases may attack
lipid contents on the cell membrane. Indeed, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a common encapsulated, Gramnegative, rod-shaped bacterium can induce cell death by ferroptosis (Dar et al., 2018). Although P. aeruginosa
itself is not equipped with arachidonic acid–phosphatidylethanolamines (AA-PE) in its cell membrane, the
bacteria synthesizes lipoxygenases (Vance et al., 2004). Similar to cytoplasmic lipoxygenases in mammalian
cells, secretable lipoxygenases from P. aeruginosa may target arachidonic acids in the cell membrane of host
cells, and transform it into 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE). Clinical P. aeruginosa isolates from
patients with persistent lower respiratory tract infections was dependent on the level and enzymatic
activity of lipoxygenases. Lipoxygenases-deficient mutant bacteria failed to induce ferroptosis in human

bronchial epithelial cells (Dar et al., 2018). It must be noted that except some types of marine bacteria,
prokaryotic bacteria do not gain the capability to metabolize PUFA lipids (Horn et al., 2015); the conserved
PUFA metabolism in P. aeruginosa indicated that bacteria may manipulate a variety of mechanisms to attack
host cells, and ferroptosis may participate in other types of infection that remains to be unraveled.
As previously described, ferroptosis is characterized by iron-dependent ROS and lipid peroxidation in the
dying cells. Therefore, increased iron levels in inflamed cells and tissues may predispose infected cells to
undergo ferroptosis. Mycobacterium tuberculosis can induce heme oxygenase-1, a host enzyme that degrades
heme to free iron (Andrade et al., 2013; Costa et al., 2016). Elevated levels of iron is accompanied by
exacerbated inflammation and augmented bacterial loads in lung tissues of patients and animals with
M. tuberculosis infection (Schaible et al., 2002; Boelaert et al., 2007). M. tuberculosis-induced macrophage
necrosis is characterized by reduced levels of GSH and Gpx4, increased free iron, mitochondrial superoxide,
and lipid peroxidation, all of which are important hallmarks of ferroptosis (Amaral et al., 2019). In addition,
ferrostatin-1 and iron chelators reduced necrotic cell death in M. tuberculosis-infected macrophage cultures.
Reduced Gpx4 expression as well as increased lipid peroxidation can be observed in lung lesions during
acute M. tuberculosis infection, whereas Fer-1-treated animals exhibited remarkable reductions in bacterial
load (Amaral et al., 2019). Together, these findings indicate that ferroptosis may participate in the
progression of certain type of microbial infection diseases.
Iron is indispensable for survival of both bacterium and vertebrate cells (Schaible and Kaufmann, 2004).
Therefore, by storing iron in the cytoplasm in the battle against microbials during infection, the host cells
can deprive microbials of iron for growth; in addition, host cells can also utilize iron to generate reactive
species to clear microbials (Lewis, 2010). The elevated iron level in the cytoplasm may lead to excessive
oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation, which may in turn result in iron-dependent cell death. Cells die not
for nothing. Dying cells may release profuse danger signals, while invading microbials may acquire nutrients
such as iron which is vital for microbial growth. Therefore, the complexity in the competition for iron
nutrient underlies the progression of microbial infections, and iron-related ROS accumulation leads to onset
of iron-dependent ferroptosis in host cells.
In addition to above-mentioned lipoxygenase-mediated and free iron-mediated lipid peroxidation by
P. aeruginosa and M. tuberculosis infection, lipid peroxidation itself may drive the process of pyroptosis. Kang
et al. demonstrated that depletion of Gpx4 results in increased septic lethality (Kang et al., 2018). Myeloidspecific conditional knockout of Gpx4 enhances caspase-11 activation and subsequent Gasdermin D
cleavage, leading to activation of pyroptosis of macrophages (Kang et al., 2018). Such results stressed that
different types of RCD are actually correlated and intertwined, and bacteria may manipulate various
strategies to avoid host defense system and cause cell death as well as tissue damage.

7. Ferroptosis in the atherosclerosis
Accumulation of ROS underlies the onset and progression of multiple pathological conditions, such as lethal

2/19/24, 10:46 AM

cancers (Wang et al., 2019), cardiovascular diseases (Baba et al., 2018), diabetes (Bruni et al., 2018), stroke
(Alim et al., 2019), Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease (Do Van et al., 2016). When lipid level is elevated in
the peripheral circulatory system, free radicals in the arterial wall may trigger a cascade of innate immune
responses characterized by endothelial activation, inflammatory mediator production, monocyte
recruitment and foam cells formation (Martinet et al., 2019). Excessive peroxidation of low-density
lipoprotein in the endothelium may activate oxidative stress in macrophages. Diverse types of regulated cell
death in lipid-laden macrophages have been reported, such as classical programmed cell death (apoptosis)
(Gonzalez and Trigatti, 2017), recently defined necroptosis (Karunakaran et al., 2016), pyroptosis (Hoseini
et al., 2018), and NETosis (Wang et al., 2017). Lipid peroxidation as well as iron deposition are common
features of advanced atherosclerotic plaques (Martinet et al., 2019); therefore, it may be assumed that
ferroptosis in macrophages may participate in the progression of atherosclerotic plaque destabilization.
Although definite evidence of ferroptosis has not been reported, it must be noted that the term ferroptosis
was newly coined in 2012 to define the specific cell death induced by the small molecule erastin (Dixon
et al., 2012). Indeed, overexpression of Gpx4 significantly lessens lipid modifications by superoxide and
impedes progression of atherosclerotic plaque in ApoE−/- mice (Guo et al., 2008), indicating that ferroptosis
may potentially underlie the progress of cardiovascular diseases. Using GPX4 knockout animal model may
better unveil whether ferroptosis decisively participated in the progress of atherosclerosis.
The role of iron overload in atherosclerosis is controversial. Atherosclerotic process is significantly
accelerated in iron-laden ApoE−/- FPNwt/C326S mice in comparison to normo-ferremic ApoE−/- mice. Nontransferrin bound serum iron causes iron overload, induces reactive oxygen species production and
apoptosis in cultured vascular cells, and stimulates massive MCP-1-mediated monocyte recruitment,
resulting in vascular oxidative stress and plaque formation (Vinchi et al., 2019). However, enhanced
atherosclerosis has not been observed in flatiron mice that bear macrophages over-loaded with iron (Kautz
et al., 2013). Indeed, being defense cells against microbial invasion and oxLDL accumulation, macrophages
are equipped with efficient antioxidant defense to balance the oxidative stress after engulfing large
quantities of microbials and oxidized LDL. Therefore, iron overload itself may not be related to the progress
of atherosclerosis, but oxidative stress in endothelial cells from non-transferrin bound serum iron may be
the culprit of aggravating the progress of atherosclerosis.

8. Ferroptosis in the ischemia-reperfusion injury
Ischemia reperfusion injuries in organs or tissues are featured by an initial phase of severe reduction or
cessation of vital blood flow, deprivation of oxygen consumption and metabolic reprogramming from
oxidative phosphorylation to anaerobic glycolysis, and a second phase of re-oxygenation with outpouring
oxidative stress (Feigin et al., 2014). Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) underlies the progress of several types
of sterile inflammation, such as organ transplantation, stroke, and myocardial infarction. Multiple
pathological events are correlated with the detrimental effects of IRI, among which the outburst of free
radicals during reperfusion after the ischemic period is the major culprit. Outpouring of hydroperoxides

Page 11 of 29

Ferroptosis as an emerging target in inflammatory diseases - ScienceDirect

2/19/24, 10:46 AM

contributes to malfunctioned protein, damaged DNA and peroxidized lipids, which may lead to eventual cell
death. Depletion of anti-oxidant enzyme Gpx4 aggravates acute renal injury in mice, while liproxstatin-1
reduces cellular iron-dependent cell death and mitigates IRI-induced hepatic injuries in Gpx4−/− mice
(Friedmann Angeli et al., 2014). Conditional kidney tubule-specific ablation of FADD and caspase-8 do not
sensitize newly isolated renal tubules from necroptosis hypoxic injury, and necrostatin-1, a classic RIPK1
inhibitor, did not guard the tubules from hypoxia injury, while ferrostatin rescued tissues from IRI
(Linkermann et al., 2014). Blocking glutaminolysis reduces intracellular glutamate levels, decreases
ferroptotic cell death sensitivity and lessens IRI-induced heart injury (Gao et al., 2015), while ferrostatin-1
and iron chelation ameliorated heart failure induced by both acute and chronic IRI in mice (Fang et al.,
2019).
Regulated cell death actually is an integral part of self-defense system. By releasing damage signals such as
alarmins, heat shock proteins and pro-IL-1β, cell death triggers sterile inflammation for the host defense
system to counter the imminent stimuli (Weinlich et al., 2017). By reducing lethal lipid peroxidation, Fer-1
treatment inhibits damage signals from dying cardiomyocytes and reduces neutrophil recruitment after
heart transplantation, which contributes to a reduced infarct size, improved left ventricular systolic function
and reduced left ventricular remodeling in myocardial IRI (Li et al., 2019a, Li et al., 2019). In addition, Fer-1
treatment impacts Toll like receptor 4- Toll/IL-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-beta
(TRIF)-type I interferon signaling pathway (Li et al., 2019a, Li et al., 2019). Ferroptosis not only occurs in the
reperfusion stage, but also participate in the ischemia phase. Inhibitors of ACSL4, a key enzyme in
elongation of PUFAs in the cell membrane, protected mice against ferroptotic cell death, and blocking
ferroptosis by liproxstatin-1 ameliorated IRI in the intestine (Li et al., 2019a, Li et al., 2019).

9. Ferroptosis in stroke
The ischemic stroke is one leading cause of death as a result of obstruction of arteries that supply sufficient
blood to the brain. Depletion of oxygen and nutrients activates excessive oxidative stress, mitochondrial
impairment and ultimate cell death (Brouns and De Deyn, 2009).
Iron is a double-edged sword in the homeostasis of brain tissue. On one hand, iron is indispensable for
catalyzing generation of profuse ATP for a normal brain function; on the other hand, the brain is highly
vulnerable to iron-dependent oxidative stress (DeGregorio-Rocasolano et al., 2019). Levels of iron are
increased in aging neurological tissues (Ayton et al., 2015). In addition, iron accumulation is well recognized
in neurons in the phase of reperfusion in both clinical cases and animal models of ischemic stroke (Ding
et al., 2011; Park et al., 2011; Domínguez et al., 2016). An early and transient increase in iron content can be
observed in ischemic cerebral tissues (Millerot-Serrurot et al., 2008). Iron-chelation agents ameliorate brain
edema, reduces neuronal death and impedes brain atrophy in the process of intracerebral hemorrhagic
stroke (Hua et al., 2008; Zeng et al., 2018; Hu et al., 2019). Lysis of erythrocytes floods the cerebral tissue
with excess of heme in the hemoglobin, and hemin has been shown to induce iron-dependent cell death in
neuronal cells, while N-acetylcysteine, a FDA–approved cysteine prodrug, blocks oxidation activity of ALOX,

2/19/24, 10:46 AM

thereby reducing ferroptosis development (Karuppagounder et al., 2018). Transient middle cerebral artery
occlusion enhances iron accumulation in the mice brain, while reduces expression of Tau, a protein
primarily found in neurons in the central nervous system. Decreased iron accumulation and reduced IRI can
be observed in Tau knockout mice after ischemic stroke; moreover, liproxstatin and ferrostatin ameliorated
infarct size after experimental stroke (Tuo et al., 2017).
In addition to disruption in the iron homeostasis in stroke, malfunction of GSH and lipid peroxidation also
underlies the development of stroke. Anti-oxidant GSH level was remarkably reduced whereas lipid
peroxidation was enhanced in ischemic brain lesions in a mouse model of ischemic brain stroke (Ahmad
et al., 2014). LOX-mediated generation of lipid hydroperoxides has been suggested to be involved in
ferroptosis (Li et al., 2018). A novel inhibitor of 12/15-lipoxygenase, LOXBlock-1, decreases neuronal
oxidative stress, reduces tissue plasminogen activator and protects mice from IRI (Yigitkanli et al., 2013).

10. Conclusions and perspectives
Since the discovery of ferroptosis, compelling evidence has shown that ferroptosis has been involved in the
development of brain degenerative diseases (Abdalkader et al., 2018) and carcinogenesis (Yang et al., 2014).
Depletion of Gpx4 and GSH, elevated lipid peroxidation products, as well as disrupted iron metabolism are
shared features in ferroptosis and inflammatory diseases. Ferroptosis has been observed in P. aeruginosa and
M. tuberculosis infection as well as non-infection inflammatory diseases, such as atherosclerosis, stroke,
intracerebral hemorrhage and ischemia/reperfusion injury. The onset of ferroptosis may disrupt the
integrity of tissue barrier and facilitate invasion of microbials (Fig. 3). However, it must be noted that
currently we do not know in what condition ROS may induce lethal lipid peroxidation in inflammatory
diseases.

levels in certain diseases may further facilitate lipid peroxidation, the core element in ferroptosis
development. Excessive lipid peroxidation may result in ferroptosis, leading to release of damage-associated
molecular patterns (DAMPs), activation immune cells and aggravation of inflammation. The release of
DAMPs and inflammatory response may further exacerbate tissue destruction, disrupt tissue barrier and
allow microbial entry.

Vertebrate cell membrane stands at the first line of defense against various microbial invasion; therefore,
phospholipids in the cell membrane inherently maintain the integrity and homeostasis of host cells.
However, present researches indicate that pathogens may manipulate several strategies to attack weakness
in phospholipids, PUFAs. For example, P. aeruginosa may directly attack PUFAs in the cell membrane by
lipoxygenases to induce lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis, while M. tuberculosis may induce iron
accumulation in the cytoplasm, which in turn oxidize lipid content in the cell membrane. More studies are
needed to explore whether ferroptosis is restricted to certain microbials.
Many questions regarding ferroptosis in inflammatory diseases should also be further investigated. By
competing for iron in the inflammatory progress, host cells may store iron in the cytoplasm for ROS
generation while decrease iron availability for pathogens. However, how the elevated iron levels in the
cytoplasm may trigger ferroptosis is currently uncertain. In addition, the significance of ferroptosis should
be further explored, such as whether it is an adaptive process to eliminate infected cells and release
invading intracellular microbials into the extracellular environment for immune recognition, whether it
induces release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including alarmins, DNAs and
mitochondria, to alert the host of imminent severe danger signal, and provides invading microbials with
plenty of nutrients. Moreover, why so many different ways for cell death are so closely entangled, by what
mechanism the host cells choose to survive or to die, and what pathogenic factors actually induce
ferroptosis are still uncertain. New techniques are needed to be discovered to detect ferroptotic cells
specifically and determine whether a cell dies from ferroptosis or other forms of regulated cell death.
In summary, the newly discovered ferroptosis provides new insights into understanding the significance of
life and death in inflammatory diseases. Better understanding of ferroptosis in infection and sterile
inflammation may help provide individualized diagnosis and optimized treatment modalities for both
infection and sterile inflammatory diseases.

Abstract
Homing-associated molecules are of fundamental
importance for proper functioning of our immune
system as they direct the cells to sites of in"ammation to
create an immune response. However, they are also
responsible for harmful cell tra#cking, which takes place
in acute and chronic in"ammations as well as in tumor
progression and metastatic spread of cancer. Therefore,
these molecules are potential targets for developing
drugs to prevent harmful in"ammation and metastases
of cancer. In this review, we will discuss about the most
recent advances in studies elucidating the role of two
homing-associated ecto-enzymes in physiological and
pathological cell tra#cking and their use as drug targets.

1 Introduction
Homing-associated molecules are important in targeting
leukocytes and other cells into speci$c positions within the
body. Molecules, which guide leukocyte tra#cking, are of
paramount importance in the function of normal innate and
acquired immunity [1]. On the other hand, inappropriate
migration of leukocytes to various target organs is a key
pathogenetic factor in a wide spectrum of in"ammatory
diseases [2]. These include traditional autoimmune diseases

such as multiple sclerosis or rheumatoid arthritis, as well as
diseases like atherosclerosis, ischemia-reperfusion injury,
obesity and Alzheimer's disease.
In addition to leukocytes, migratory nature is a hallmark of
metastatic cancer cells. In fact, the malignant cells share
with the leukocytes the routes of migration within the body
(blood and lymphatic vasculature) and they also share many
common molecular mechanisms by which the cellular
targeting is accomplished [3]. Moreover, the active roles of
di%erent pro- and anti-tumorigenic leukocyte subclasses
during the tumor progression have become increasingly
evident during the past few years [4]. In particular, tumors
seem to be able to evade the anti-tumor immunity by
inducing and attracting various immunosuppressive
leukocyte subtypes, such as regulatory T cells, type 2
macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, into the
growing tumor.
The leukocyte tra#cking molecules allow leukocytes to
patrol throughout the whole body [1, 2]. Typically, the newly
formed mononuclear and polymorphonuclear leukocytes
circulate freely in the blood vasculature. At speci$c
locations, such as in normal high endothelial venules (HEV)
in lymphoid organs, or in in"amed venules in almost any
organ they are able to leave the blood and extravasate into

the tissue. The extravasation cascade starts by tethering
and rolling of the leukocyte on the endothelial cells. If
followed by suitable activation stimuli, the leukocyte can
then $rmly adhere to the endothelial cell, and $nally
transmigrate through the inter-endothelial junctions, or
through the endothelial cell, into the tissue to exert its
e%ector functions.
The distinct steps of the extravasation cascade are typically
mediated by di%erent receptor–ligand pairs on the two
opposing cell types. Thus, selectins and their
oligosaccharide-based ligands presented on sialomucin-like
proteins are key mediators of the transient $rst contacts,
whereas chemokines and their receptors are heavily
involved at the activation step [5, 6]. Thereafter, integrins on
the leukocytes and their ligands belonging to the
immunoglobulin super-family on the endothelium, together
with certain homotypically interacting molecules such as
CD31 and CD99, play essential roles in the $rm adhesion
and transmigration [7-9].
In addition to these classical homing-associated molecules
several other proteins both on leukocytes and endothelial
cells are known to be critical in controlling leukocyte
tra#cking. Among these are vascular adhesion molecule-1
(VAP-1) and CD73, two di%erent cell-surface expressed
enzymes. Here we focus on the potential role of these two
molecules in controlling the movement of leukocytes in
in"ammatory and malignant conditions. We will give a brief
overview on the earlier studies central to the concept of
ecto-enzymatic control of leukocyte tra#cking, but will focus
on the new advances that have been published since our
latest comprehensive review on this topic appeared in the
beginning of 2008.

oxidase VAP-1
VAP-1 was originally reported as an endothelial adhesion
molecule able to support lymphocyte adhesion to HEV in
man [10]. It is also inducible on the luminal surface of
vessels with "at-walled endothelium under in"ammatory
conditions [11]. In addition to endothelial cells, VAP-1 is
abundantly present in adipose cells, in which it is involved in
glucose uptake, and in smooth muscle cells, in which its
functions remain poorly understood [12-15].
VAP-1 is a primary amine oxidase (E.C. 1.4.3.21; also known
as semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO) or amine
oxidase, copper dependent 3 (AOC3) [16]. The enzymatic
activity of VAP-1 converts soluble primary amines into the
corresponding aldehydes [17, 18]. At the $rst step of this
two step reaction, the amine substrate forms a transient
Schi%-base with the enzyme, the enzyme is reduced and
then the corresponding aldehyde is released. In the second
half-reaction the enzyme is oxidized back to its original state
in a reaction, which also produces ammonium ions and
hydrogen peroxide. The catalytic activity of VAP-1 is critically
dependent on a tyrosine residue (at position 471 in human),
which is spontaneously self-processed into a topaquinone
(6-hydroxydopa) co-factor [19]. Despite the fact that the
catalytic reaction driven by VAP-1 has been dissected in
great detail, the identity of soluble endogenous VAP-1
substrates still remain enigmatic. It is known that both
methylamine and aminoacetone, side products of
intermediary metabolism in man, can serve as good VAP-1
substrates, but more abundant physiological substrates
may well exist [17].
The VAP-1 molecule consists of an extracellular part, which
harbors the catalytic site, a transmembrane segment, and a
short intracellular N-terminal tail [20, 21]. On the plasma

2/19/24, 11:26 AM

membrane VAP-1 normally forms a homodimer of two 90
kDa glycoproteins. The extracellular part of each monomer
consists of three domains (D2-D4). VAP-1 has a relatively
narrow substrate channel formed by domains D4 and D3
and a key leusine (469 in human) guards the entry of
substrates. The large D4 domains, from each subunit, form
the dimer interface and each also contains a catalytic site,
buried at the base of a deep cleft.

3 Anti-VAP-1 mAbs inhibit
leukocyte migration in
in!ammation
VAP-1 has been shown to regulate leukocyte-endothelial
interactions in a number of in vitro and in vivo models.
Inhibition of VAP-1 by function-blocking monoclonal
antibodies inhibits lymphocyte, monocyte and granulocyte
binding to HEV and in"amed "at walled vessels in many
di%erent tissues such as peripheral lymph nodes, skin,
heart, gut, synovium, kidney and liver in frozen section
assays [10, 22-26]. The anti-VAP-1 mAbs also reduce rolling,
$rm adhesion and transmigration of granulocytes and/or
lymphocytes under conditions of laminar "ow on di%erent
types of VAP-1 positive endothelial cells [27, 28]. More
recently, a unique subpopulation of CD16+ monocytes has
also been shown to rely partially on VAP-1 in adhesion to
and transmigration through hepatic endothelial cells under
shear [29]. In intravital videomicroscopy studies, anti-VAP-1
mAbs reduce the number of rolling, $rmly adherent and
transmigratory granulocytes [30, 31]. In in vivo animal
models function-blocking anti-VAP-1 mAbs diminish
in"ammatory cell in$ltration in many experimental models
including peritonitis, type 1 diabetes, hepatitis, skin
in"ammations and allograft rejection [30, 32-34].

4 VAP-1 enzyme inhibitors
attenuate in!ammation
The function of VAP-1 cannot only be blocked by mAbs, but
also by speci$c inhibitors of its enzyme activity.
Traditionally, small carbonyl reactive substances such as
hydroxylamine, semicarbazide or 2-bromoethylamine, have
been employed as VAP-1 inhibitors. Later on several new
VAP-1 inhibitors belonging to hydrazine derivatives (such as
BTT-2052/SZE5302 and LJP1207), haloalkylamines,
arylalkylamines, propenyl- and propargylamines, and
oxazolidines with improved speci$city and biocompatibility
have been developed [35, 36].
With these inhibitors it has become evident that the
enzymatic activity of VAP-1 is important in the leukocyte
extravasation, in particular during the transmigration step.
Thus, inhibition of exogenously or endogenously expressed
VAP-1 by hydroxylamine or semicarbazide signi$cantly
reduces leukocyte transmigration through an endothelial
monolayer in in vitro "ow assays [28, 37]. The inhibitors are
also e%ective in alleviating in"ammation in in vivo models.
This was initially demonstrated in air pouch in"ammation
and adjuvant and anti-collagen antibody induced arthritis
models by BTT-2052 [27, 38]. Later, enzymatic inhibition of
VAP-1 with di%erent inhibitors has been successfully used to
ameliorate colitis, ischemia-reperfusion injury of lung,
stroke, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE),
sepsis and transplant rejection [39-42]. In the EAE model,
VAP-1 inhibitors showed notable e#cacy in preventing an
already established in"ammatory response in the central
nervous system even when initiated later during the
relapsing-remitting course of the disease [42].
More recently, several publications have indicated that VAP1 can inhibit leukocyte in$ltration into the in"amed eye. In a

2/19/24, 11:26 AM

rat model of uveitis, the in"ammation induced the
expression of VAP-1 in the vasculature of the retina [43]. An
SSAO inhibitor alleviated accumulation of leukocytes in the
di%erent anatomical compartments of the eye. Also in a rat
model of diabetic retinopathy, inhibition of VAP-1 markedly
reduced leukocyte transmigration into the retina [44].
Moreover, in another rat eye model relevant to age-related
macular degeneration, SSAO inhibition signi$cantly reduced
the numbers of choroidal macrophages, and the amount of
neovascularization and the leakiness of the newly formed
vessels [45]. Very recently, VAP-1 was shown to be induced
by IL-1 in a corneal neovascularization model in mice. VAP-1
inhibitors inhibited IL-1 induced type 2 macrophage
in$ltration and both angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis in
that model [46]. Although another member of the primary
amine oxidase family, retina-speci$c amine oxidase AOC2,
may contribute to the observed e%ects in mice (and
humans), rats lack this protein [47]. Moreover, VAP-1 is
expressed in the vasculature of the eye [48]. Nevertheless,
all eye models were done using a single 1,3-thiazole based
SSAO inhibitor, and it would be interesting to con$rm the
observations using VAP-1 de$cient mice. In any case the
elegant eye models show that the SSAO activity plays an
important role in the generation of the intraocular
in"ammatory response.
Taken together, enzymatic inhibitors of VAP-1 have shown
notable anti-in"ammatory e%ects in multiple in vivo models.
Nevertheless, the speci$city of the inhibitors against other
SSAO family members, including retinal amine oxidase and
diamine oxidase, and possibly against some unrelated
molecules, has not been tested very thoroughly under in
vivo conditions.

altered in!ammatory reactions
Generation of VAP-1 de$cient mice has con$rmed the
enzymatic and adhesive functions of this oxidase in vivo.
Mice lacking VAP-1 are grossly normal but show almost
complete absence of primary amine oxidase activity in the
tissue [31]. These mice show faster rolling (less e#cient
leukocyte-endothelial cell contacts), reduced number of
$rmly adherent cells, and a clear inhibition of leukocyte
transmigration into sites of in"ammation. Moreover,
in"ammatory reactions such as peritonitis and arthritis, and
responses to mucosal immunization are attenuated in the
absence of VAP-1 [38, 49].
VAP-1 also seems to contribute to leukocyte homeostasis in
the fat tissue. VAP-1 is induced in white adipose tissue in
genetically obese mouse strains [50]. Moreover, VAP-1
de$cient mice are slightly more obese with larger white
adipose tissues than their wild-type controls [51].
Nevertheless, there were fewer T cells, macrophages, NK
cells and NKT cells in the fat tissue in the mice lacking VAP-1.
Thus, homing of di%erent leukocyte subclasses into fat,
which is now known to be important for the induction of the
chronic low-state in"ammation associated with obesity, is
regulated by VAP-1. Moreover, the VAP-1 de$cient mice
provide a new model of mild obesity, in which the numbers
of fat cells and in$ltrating leukocytes are not directly
associated to each other.

6 VAP-1 modulates leukocyte
migration into tumors
VAP-1 may support tumor progression. In early studies we
showed that anti-VAP-1 mAbs inhibit the adhesion of NK
cells and tumor in$ltrating lymphocytes to VAP-1 positive
neovessels within the tumors [52]. More recently we have
https://febs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.febslet.2011.04.033

Homing-associated molecules CD73 and VAP-1 as targets to prevent ha… cancer spread - Salmi - 2011 - FEBS Letters - Wiley Online Library

2/19/24, 11:26 AM

found that in VAP-1 de$cient mice melanoma and
lymphoma tumors grew more slowly than in wild-type
animals [53]. The tumors in VAP-1 −/− host had defective
angiogenesis, and impaired recruitment of myeloid-derived
suppressor cells (MDSC). Notably, if the MDSC were ablated
from the mice, VAP-1 de$ciency no longer protected the
animals. Moreover, genetic experiments with a transgenic
mice expressing an enzymatically inactive mutant of VAP-1
showed that the e%ects on MDSC accumulation were
dependent on the oxidase activity of VAP-1.
The SSAO inhibitors also retard tumor progression. The
SSAO inhibitor treated mice show diminished numbers of
Gr-1+CD11b+ MDSC in the tumor as well as impaired
neoangiogenesis [54]. These experiments not only provide
two independent lines of evidence for the role of VAP-1 in
leukocyte migration into the tumors, but also suggest that
targeting of VAP-1 might have potential as an adjunctive
treatment for the inhibition of tumor progression.
Currently we hypothesize that the VAP-1 expressing
neoangiogenic vessels in the tumor bind MSDC. As a
consequence, the intratumoral numbers of this particular
pro-tumorigenic leukocyte subtype are selectively increased,
with a concomitant stimulation of the neoangiogenesis and
enhancement of the immune-suppressing gene signature of
the tumor microenvironment.

7 VAP-1 as a signaling molecule
Hydrogen peroxide has emerged to be a powerful signaling
molecule at low concentrations [55]. VAP-1 derived
hydrogen peroxide, together with low dose vanadate, was
initially shown to modulate glucose transport and GLUT4
recruitment by phosphorylating insulin receptor substrate-1
and -3, and PI-3-kinase in rat fat cells [56]. Later on, VAP-1

Page 9 of 45

2/19/24, 11:26 AM

derived H2O2 (without vanadate) has been found to activate
several key transcription factors including NF-kB and p53
[57, 58]. Hydrogen peroxide emerging from the catalytic
activity of VAP-1 increases the expression of classical
adhesion molecules such as E-selectin, P-selectin and
MadCAM-1, and chemokines such as CXCL8 in di%erent in
vitro and in vivo models [57, 59, 60]. Use of mutant mice
expressing an enzymatically inactive point mutation in VAP1 has veri$ed in vivo that VAP-1 dependent up-regulation of
P-selectin and MadCAM-1 are dependent on the oxidase
activity of VAP-1 [59, 60]. Thus, the enzyme-activity
dependent adhesive functions of VAP-1 may be at least
partially mediated through the H2O2-dependent signaling
cascades, which alter the expression and/or function of
other homing-associated molecules.

8 Novel counter-receptors of VAP1 on the leukocyte
The leukocyte molecules(s) binding to VAP-1 have escaped
characterization for almost 20 years. Very recently, panning
of phage display libraries with recombinant VAP-1 has led to
the identi$cation of the $rst cellular counter-receptors of
VAP-1. These experiments showed that VAP-1 binds to
Siglec-9 and Siglec-10 proteins both in cell free proteinprotein interaction assays and in di%erent cell based models
[61] (and our unpublished results).
Siglecs belong to a family of lectin molecules, which bind to
sialic acids and mediate various adhesive and signaling
events both within the immune system and elsewhere in
the body [62]. The cellular distributions of Siglec-9 and -10
are very di%erent: Siglec-9 is expressed on all granulocytes,
whereas Siglec-10 is present mainly on B-cells. Based on
molecular modeling it is plausible that both Siglecs can

https://febs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.febslet.2011.04.033

Page 10 of 45

Homing-associated molecules CD73 and VAP-1 as targets to prevent ha… cancer spread - Salmi - 2011 - FEBS Letters - Wiley Online Library

2/19/24, 11:26 AM

present speci$c arginine residues into the enzymatic cavity
of VAP-1. Although the side chain of arginine terminates in a
complex guanidinium structure rather than in a normal
primary amine, the arginine 293 of Siglec-10 has been
experimentally demonstrated to function as a substrate of
VAP-1 [61]. Thus, these molecules can apparently serve as
surface-bound substrates of VAP-1. Currently it is not clear,
whether the sialic acid modi$cations of VAP-1 are necessary
for the binding to Siglecs.
Siglec-VAP-1 interaction can be utilized for imaging of
in"ammation in vivo (our unpublished results). Short
synthetic Siglec-9 peptides (containing the VAP-1 interacting
core sequence) localize selectively to sites of in"ammation
in vivo in VAP-1 expressing transgenic mice, but not in VAP-1
de$cient mice. This $nding is compatible with the fact that
in normal non-in"amed vessels in the periphery VAP-1
resides in cytoplasmic vesicles, from which it is translocated
onto the luminal surface only in in"ammation [63].

9 Dual mode of function of VAP-1:
the current hypothesis
VAP-1 is believed to have both enzyme activity dependent
and enzyme activity independent adhesive functions [20].
The latter ones are those blocked by anti-VAP-1 mAbs,
which do not inhibit the oxidase activity of VAP-1. On the
other hand, a single point mutation at the critical Tyr 471
renders VAP-1 unable to support leukocyte transmigration
under "ow conditions. This mutant still harbors the
epitopes for anti-VAP-1 mAbs, but its adhesion supporting
properties cannot any more be inhibited by anti-VAP-1
antibodies. Moreover, in vitro "ow assays have shown that
the anti-VAP-1 and SSAO inhibitor treatments do not display
additive e%ects. Therefore, we favor a model, in which a

2/19/24, 11:26 AM

leukocyte $rst makes a contact with VAP-1 expressed on
endothelial cells by using its counter-receptor (Siglecs or
other cell-surface expressed ligands) to interact with the
surface of VAP-1 (anti-VAP-1 antibody epitopes). Then, the
leukocyte can present a cell surface amine into the
substrate channel of VAP-1. This leads to the oxidative
reaction involving a covalent, but transient interaction of the
counter-receptor (a substrate) with the endothelial VAP-1
(an enzyme), modi$cation of the leukocyte cell-surface
substrate into an aldehyde and release of biologically active
hydrogen peroxide and ammonium.

10 VAP-1 based clinical trials: a
prognostic biomarker and a
potential drug target
A soluble form of VAP-1 (sVAP-1) is found in the blood of
normal persons [64]. It is most likely formed by a
proteinase-mediated shedding of the endothelial and other
surface expressed forms of VAP-1 [65, 66]. The
concentration of sVAP-1 is increased in a limited set of
in"ammatory diseases. The most notable elevations are
seen in type 1 and type 2 diabetes and in certain liver
diseases such as alcholic and primary biliary chirrosis.
[66-69]. In a striking contrast to the majority of classical
endothelial adhesion molecules, sVAP-1 is not induced in
many other in"ammatory diseases such as rheumatoid
arthritis or in"ammatory bowel diseases [66]. In type 2
diabetes, sVAP-1 even serves as an independent prognostic
marker for the diabetic complications and it predicts the risk
for cardiovascular and cancer mortality in these patients
[26].
Increased sVAP-1 levels are also seen in cancer patients.
Recent studies indicate that patients with low sVAP-1 levels
https://febs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.febslet.2011.04.033

Page 12 of 45

Homing-associated molecules CD73 and VAP-1 as targets to prevent ha… cancer spread - Salmi - 2011 - FEBS Letters - Wiley Online Library

2/19/24, 11:26 AM

have signi$cantly worse prognosis of colorectal cancer, and
that sVAP-1 is an independent marker of hepatic and lymph
node metastasis in these patients [70]. A similar correlation
with low sVAP-1 and poor prognosis was reported in gastric
cancer [71].
The ample evidence from in vitro and preclinical in vivo
models demonstrates that VAP-1 contributes to the
in"ammatory reaction in several di%erent settings, and
therefore it is a potential target for anti-in"ammatory
therapeutics. It should be noted, however, that there are
certain important di%erences in the expression and function
of VAP-1 between di%erent species. One of the biggest
di%erences is in liver. Sinusoidal endothelial cells in human
liver express high levels of VAP-1, whereas the
corresponding vessels in mouse express VAP-1 only very
faintly or not at all under normal conditions [22, 72].
Moreover, mouse VAP-1 oxidates a wider repertoire of
substrates than human VAP-1 [72], which suggests the
existence of subtle di%erences in the active sites of the
enzymes between the two species. These di%erences should
be taken into account when designing inhibitors for human
use and testing them in preclinical mouse models.
To date only anti-VAP-1 antibodies have been administered
to patients. Initially, the original anti-VAP-1 mouse mAb 1B2
was administered to contact dermatitis patients, and found
to be safe, but cleared from the circulation very rapidly [73].
This has led to the development of chimeric and humanized,
and lately, fully human anti-VAP-1 mAbs for clinical trials.
The $rst phase I/IIa studies show that function-blocking fully
human anti-VAP-1 mAbs are safe and pharmacokinetically
feasible reagents, when administered into rheumatoid
arthritis or psoriasis patients. Importantly, they also
suggested preliminary therapeutic e#cacy

!ammation/vap1_antibody). Analyses of the e#cacy of
anti-VAP-1 blockade in clinical settings await for further
studies. The development of multiple novel small molecular
VAP-1 enzyme inhibitors by di%erent pharmaceutical
companies also indicates that blocking of this modality of
VAP-1 function seems to be therapeutically attractive.

11 CD73 – regulator of adenosine
production
CD73 is an ectoenzyme (ecto-5′-nucleotidase, EC 3.1.3.5)
mainly expressed on endothelial and epithelial cells and on
a subset of lymphocytes, especially on regulatory T cells. It is
a part of extracellular ATP metabolism and catalyzes
conversion of AMP to adenosine. Adenosine is highly antiin"ammatory, since it increases endothelial barrier function
and has suppressive e%ects on leukocytes. It exerts its
e%ects via adenosine receptors A1, A2A, A2B and A3.
Depending on the triggering pathway and adenosine
concentration the e%ects can be either activating or
inhibiting. In in"ammatory conditions, increased adenosine
levels lead to diminished production of activating cytokines
and decreased expression of certain adhesion molecules
such as E-selectin and ICAM-1 on endothelium and beta 2
integrins on leukocytes [74-77].

12 Distinct roles of CD73 on
lymphatic and vascular
endothelium
CD73 participates in leukocyte extravasation from the blood
into the in"amed tissues. Experimental evidence suggests
that when a leukocyte binds to endothelial CD73, its
enzymatic activity becomes inhibited leading to decreased
adenosine production. The remaining adenosine is rapidly

2/19/24, 11:26 AM

degraded by adenosine deaminase. Thus, this process
facilitates leukocyte transmigration through the vascular
endothelium [78].
Besides vascular endothelium, the lymphatic endothelium is
also CD73 positive. Interestingly, CD73 seems to be so far
the only molecule discriminating the a%erent and e%erent
arms of the lymphatics. It is expressed on a%erent but not
on e%erent lymphatics. In general, lymphocyte recirculation
routes between blood and lymphoid tissues are well known.
Also the molecular mechanisms mediating lymphocyte
entry from the blood via the postcapillary venules into the
tissues have been thoroughly analyzed [1, 2, 5-9]. In
contrast, much less is known about the tra#cking
mechanisms of leukocytes within lymphatics. All leukocytes
can enter the lymph node via the a%erent lymphatics, but
only lymphocytes can leave the node via the e%erent ones.
Thus, the tra#cking mechanisms via the a%erent lymphatics
into the draining lymph nodes and those responsible for the
continuation of the lymphocyte journey via the e%erent
lymphatics are presumably di%erent. Therefore, we recently
analyzed the role of CD73 in lymphatics and, against our
expectations, found that lymphatic CD73 did not contribute
to the migration. Instead, lymphocyte CD73 was important
in mediating lymphocyte migration via the a%erent
lymphatics. Thus, we can currently conclude that CD73 on
blood vessel endothelium and on lymphatic endothelium
have distinct adhesive roles [79].

13 CD73 both on cancer cells and
tumor in"ltrating leukocytes
contribute to the cancer behavior
CD73 is also expressed on malignancies such as leukemia
and certain cancers of epithelial cell origin [80, 81]. It is

thought to provide survival advantage to the cancer cells by
providing a salvage pathway in situations, where
antimetabolites are used as cancer treatments to block the
de novo synthesis of purines [82]. In fact, expression and
activity of CD73 on cancer cells is associated with poor
prognosis and may promote metastasis [83, 84].
Experimental cancer models have provided excellent tools
to dissect the mechanisms behind this phenomenon more
thoroughly. Gene expression pro$ling of tumor xenografts
has shown CD73 to associate to lymph node metastases of
breast cancer [85] and expression arrays have revealed that
CD73 can protect leukemic cells from TRAIL-induced
apoptosis [86]. Involvement of cancer cell CD73 in
metastasis is well in line with the role of lymphocyte CD73 in
normal migration of lymphocytes via a%erent lymphatics
into the draining lymph nodes [79]. Moreover, CD73-derived
adenosine acting via A2A receptor has been shown to
increase tumor cell chemotaxis. This may contribute to
metastasis of tumor cells as well [87]. An additional mode of
action of tumor CD73 is down-regulation of anti-tumor
immunity, since blockade of its adenosinergic e%ects
improves adoptive T cell therapy [88]. Although many of the
CD73 e%ects are consequences of its adenosine production,
also more direct interactions have been reported. The
protection from TRAIL-induced apoptosis does not involve
enzymatic activity of CD73. Instead, it is thought to be
mediated by direct binding of CD73 to the death receptor 5
[86].
Furthermore, CD73 of the host origin contributes to tumor
behavior. Tumor in$ltrating lymphocyte population contains
variable number of regulatory T cells. They are considered
to be harmful as they dampen the anti-tumor immune
response. CD73 on regulatory T cells and adenosine A2A
receptor on activated T cells form immunosuppressive

loops [89] and this may be envisaged to take place between
the lymphocyte pools in cancer. The existing literature
clearly demonstrates that CD73 exerts its functions in
several ways during cancer development and acts both on
cancer cells and non-malignant host cells. Overall, the
mechanisms seem to work for the bene$t of the cancer cells
by helping them to escape the immuno-surveillance.
Knockout mice have been valuable in searching for the role
of the host CD73 in cancer development [90, 91]. In colon
cancer, lymphoma, mammary tumor and melanoma models
lack of host CD73 leads to retarded tumor growth. This is
due to decreased numbers of suppressive type 2
macrophages within the tumors and increased activity of
CD8 positive T cells. The studies have further revealed that
pro-tumorigenic e%ects of regulatory T cells are dependent
on their CD73 expression and endothelial CD73 may be
critical in promoting lung metastases [91].

14 Lack of CD73 leads to di#erent
consequences in mouse and man
The central role of CD73 at sites of in"ammation and
hypoxic conditions can be realized in knockout mice lacking
CD73 [92-94]. These animals show enhanced leukocyte
adhesion to vascular endothelium in an ischemiareperfusion model [95] and increased vascular leakiness
and leukocyte migration to in"ammatory sites in acute lung
injury [96]. All this is in perfect agreement with the known
role of adenosine in in"ammation. However, the $ndings
regarding brain in"ammation in EAE model have been
surprising, because mice lacking CD73 are protected from
the disease [97]. The results obtained in EAE suggest that
both lymphocyte and endothelial CD73 is needed for proper
entrance of lymphocytes into the brain in EAE. This suggests

an organ speci$c role for CD73 in in"ammation and less
signi$cant contribution of CD73-derived adenosine to
endothelial leakiness in murine blood-brain-barrier than in
vasculature elsewhere in the body. In this context it is
important to note, that expression of CD73 in the murine
brain is di%erent from that in human brain [97, 98]. Only
occasional CD73 positive vessels can be found in murine
brain, whereas CD73 is expressed abundantly in the
vasculature of human brain.
Regarding CD73 another di%erence can be detected on
a%erent lymphatics, most of which are CD73 positive in
humans. In contrast, only a minority of these lymphatics
expresses CD73 in mouse [76].
Recently mutations in human CD73 gene have been
identi$ed leading to decreased CD73 concentrations and
enzymatic activity. These patients su%er from symptomatic
calci$cations in lower-extremity arteries and in hand and
foot joint capsules. Therefore, it is believed that CD73 is
involved in the pathways preventing ectopic calci$cation
[99]. This has not been observed in CD73 de$cient mice.

15 Clinical implications of CD73
When evaluating the potential of a particular target for drug
development it should be remembered that the data
obtained with mouse disease models may not be directly
transferable to humans, because the expression and/or
function of the murine homolog may di%er from that of
humans. Thus, caution is also warranted when evaluating
the results obtained from CD73 studies performed in
mouse.
Due to its anti-in"ammatory e%ects adenosine is a potent
substance to alleviate in"ammation. However, due to its

extremely short half-life its use is not very feasible in clinics.
Theoretically, mediators up-regulating endogenous CD73
could serve as alternatives providing a more constant
increase in CD73-derived adenosine. Such factors are
interferon-beta and alpha. Both these interferons upregulate human CD73 on vasculature without having any
e%ects on CD73 on lymphocytes and cancer cells [81, 98].
Similarly, interferon-beta up-regulates murine endothelial
CD73 and gives protection in acute lung injury in mice [96].
A clinical phase II study with interferon-beta is ongoing in
patients su%ering from severe lung in"ammation
(http://www.faronpharmaceuticals.com/).
One large patient group getting interferon-beta medication
is patients su%ering from multiple sclerosis (MS). CD73 in
these patients’ sera and endothelial CD73 increase
subsequent to interferon-beta therapy and this correlates
with clinical improvement of the patients [98]. Thus, part of
the e#cacy of interferon-beta therapy in MS disease may be
mediated by CD73. It can be envisioned that interferon-beta
up-regulates CD73 on brain vasculature leading to increased
adenosine production. Adenosine improves endothelial
barrier function that results in diminished in$ltration of the
in"ammatory cells into the brain.
Statins have also been shown to up-regulate CD73 and
adenosine production. They may be bene$cial as a shortterm therapy, when transient CD73 increase is needed for
example in ischemia-reperfusion injury or as a preconditioning treatment [100, 101]. Their long-term e%ects,
however, may be questionable as in vitro studies have
demonstrated that statins increase CD73 expression and
activity by preventing its endocytosis without increasing its
synthesis [102]. Clinical trials with statins meant to target
CD73 independently of their cholesterol lowering e%ects are
ongoing or recently completed (http://clinicaltrials.gov/).

In oncology, CD73 seems to be harmful as it enhances
tumor growth and metastasis both in various pre-clinical
models and in human tumors [84, 87, 88, 90]. In this disease
group, inhibition of CD73 would hypothetically be bene$cial.
In preclinical models anti-CD73 antibody therapy, small
molecular inhibitors of CD73 as well as targeting of
adenosine receptor A2A have shown their potential [87, 88,
90]. Whether they will also show e#cacy in the clinical
settings remains to be seen in future. Potentially also other
adenosine receptors can be targeted to prevent tumor
growth. A3 adenosine receptor agonists are able to
suppress survival and proliferation of colon carcinoma cells
in murine tumor models [103]. They can also decrease
proliferation and metastasis of rat prostate cancer cells
[104]. Moreover, an A3 receptor agonist induced apoptosis
and inhibited tumor growth of hepatocellular carcinoma in
rats [105]. Whether A3 receptor agonists are also bene$cial
for patients will be evaluated in a currently ongoing clinical
trial targeting hepatocellular carcinoma
(http://www.can"te.com/CF102.htm).

16 Conclusions
Aberrant leukocyte tra#cking to sites of in"ammation is
often harmful leading to tissue damage and migrating
malignant cells form the metastases in cancer. Therefore,
molecules responsible for the harmful tra#c are
theoretically excellent targets to cure in"ammations and
prevent cancer spread. VAP-1 and CD73 are both
ectoenzymes, which act via direct interactions with their
counter-receptors and more importantly, exert their e%ects
via the end-products of their enzymatic activity. The endproducts are potent mediators that have several e%ects
modulating the cellular microenvironments. In the case of
VAP-1 the end-products are pro-in"ammatory, whereas

adenosine produced by CD73 is highly anti-in"ammatory.
Thus it would be bene$cial to suppress VAP-1 and activate
CD73 to alleviate in"ammatory reactions. However, in
cancer both CD73 and VAP-1 have serious unwanted
properties leading to accelerated cancer growth, metastasis
formation and suppression of the anti-tumor immune
response. Therefore, in this diverse entity inhibition of both
VAP-1 and CD73 appears desirable. In the context of CD73 it
is important to note that up-regulation of CD73 by
interferon-beta therapy is unlikely to cause a threat of
cancer progression, since in cancer the contribution of
lymphocyte and cancer cell CD73 rather than endothelial
CD73 appears to be critical [81]. A schematic presentation of
the role of CD73 and VAP-1 in cancer and in"ammations is
shown in Fig. 1 .

In comparison to other tra#cking-associated molecules,
ectoenzymes provide pharmaceutical industry with unique
targets, because their enzymatic activity o%ers additional
approaches for modulation with small molecular drugs.

pre-clinical and clinical studies VAP-1 and CD73 are potential
candidates to treat in"ammation and cancer. The current
and future clinical trials will show their true value in clinical
medicine.

DESIGN: Prospective diagnostic study.
OBJECTIVES: Primary imaging-based diagnosis of spinal cord tumor-suspected lesions is often challenging. The identiﬁcation of
the deﬁnite entity is crucial for dedicated treatment and therefore reduction of morbidity. The aim of this trial was to investigate
speciﬁc quantitative signal patterns to differentiate unclear intramedullary tumor-suspected lesions based on diffusion tensor
imaging (DTI).
SETTING: Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Germany.
METHODS: Forty patients with an unclear tumor-suspected lesion of the spinal cord prospectively underwent DTI. Primary
diagnosis was determined by histological or clinical work-up or remained indeterminate with follow-up. DTI metrics (FA/ADC) were
evaluated at the central lesion area, lesion margin, edema, and normal spinal cord and compared between different diagnostic
groups (ependymomas, other spinal cord tumors, inﬂammations).
RESULTS: Mean DTI metrics for all spinal cord tumors (n = 18) showed signiﬁcantly reduced FA and increased ADC values
compared to inﬂammatory lesions (n = 8) at the lesion margin (p < 0.001, p = 0.001) and reduced FA at the central lesion area (p <
0.001). There were no signiﬁcant differences comparing the neoplastic subgroups of ependymomas (n = 10) and other spinal cord
tumors (n = 8), but remaining differences for both compared to the inﬂammation subgroup. We found signiﬁcant higher ADC (p =
0.040) and a trend to decreased FA (p = 0.081) for ependymomas compared to inﬂammations at the edema.
CONCLUSION: Even if distinct differentiation of ependymomas from other spinal cord neoplasms was not possible based on
quantitative DTI metrics, FA and ADC were feasible to separate inﬂammatory lesions. This may avoid unnecessary surgery in
patients with unclear intramedullary tumor-suspected lesions.

INTRODUCTION
Spinal cord tumors (SCT) are rare and surgical intervention is
usually required [1, 2]. The neurological status and the
histological diagnosis are the most important factors for longterm outcome [2–4]. Complete surgical resection is the primary
goal for spinal ependymoma, hemangioblastoma and other
non-inﬁltrating tumors. For inﬁltrating neoplastic entities, like
astrocytic tumors or lymphomas, cautious procedures with
biopsy for histological classiﬁcation and following radiotherapy
are primarily recommended. A non-surgical treatment is
required for tumor-mimicking inﬂammatory lesions. An invasive
diagnostic procedure or treatment with the risk for neurological
deterioration has to be avoided in such cases.
Therefore, reliable presurgical diagnostics are required to
achieve optimal functional outcome of affected patients. For
imaging-based diagnosis of SCT, magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) is the gold standard, because of its highest lesion

perceptibility and anatomic resolution [5, 6]. Conventional
acquired T2- and T1-weighted sequences without and with
contrast enhancement (CE) are state of the art [2, 7–9]. There are
several newer MRI techniques, like MR spectroscopy, Phasecontrast imaging or Diffusion-weighted imaging, but which were
mainly applied in studies. They have not entered clinical routine
yet, because the precise diagnostic value is often still heterogeneous due to the rather small case series. Some spinal cord
lesions present typical signal clusters within the conventional
MRI sequences, like hemangioblastomas with usually strong
nodular CE, vascularization, associated cysts and surrounding
edema, or cavernomas with CE on T1-weighted images and
usually blood degradation products within the spinal mass [7].
The characterization of other entities, especially the differentiation of astrocytic tumors and ependymomas, remains still
challenging [7, 10, 11]. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), a special
MRI technique with depiction of tissue diffusion alterations and

strengths, was reported to enhance the diagnosis of entity and
characteristics of SCT within some case series [12–16], but not yet
in larger clinical trials. This effect seems to be based on the
different structure of the tumor mass itself as well as the
constitution of the surrounding spinal cord tissue [16].
Because of the high relevance for further treatment planning, it
is crucial to improve the presurgical imaging diagnostics. We
expected to gain an imaging-based differentiation of noninﬁltrating ependymomas from other SCT and inﬂammatory
lesions by a speciﬁc quantitative DTI parameter conﬁguration.
METHODS

The aim of this prospective, diagnostic study was to investigate speciﬁc
quantitative signal patterns to classify unclear intramedullary tumorsuspected lesions based on DTI.

Study population

Patient data were sampled within a prospective, single-center, single-arm
cohort study. The study was approved by the local ethics committee
(reference 145/14) and reported to the national clinical trial registry
(DRKS00008994). We prospectively included patients who presented with
an unclear, intramedullary, tumor-suspected lesion through the outpatient
clinic or the Emergency Center of the Department of Neurosurgery and
Neuroradiology of the University Medical Center Freiburg between 2014
and 2019. All patients gave their written consent. In case of age <18 years,
the consent was given by a parent or legal guardian. Patients with
radiological clearly deﬁnable diagnosis on conventional MRI, like
hemangioblastoma, cavernoma or lipoma, were excluded. Additional
exclusion criteria were the common MRI contraindications.

Patient data

Patients’ baseline characteristics and clinical status by modiﬁed McCormick
Score (mMCS) were documented [17]. There was no deﬁned follow-up
procedure for the included patients due to the primary diagnostic imaging
setting of the study.

Evaluation of conventional MRI

According to the usual radiological work-up, conventional T1-weighted
sequences in sagittal and transverse plane without and with contrast
agent and T2-weighted sequences in sagittal und transverse plane were
analyzed in every patient concerning the following common imaging
features: none, slight (thickened spinal cord with remaining perimedullary cerebrospinal ﬂuid space) or severe (thickened spinal cord with
complete occupation of the spinal canal) space occupation; central or
asymmetric intramedullary position; presence of one or multiple
associated tumor cysts or intralesional hemorrhages; no, mild (less
than two vertebral bodies), moderate (two to ﬁve vertebral bodies) or
extensive (more than ﬁve vertebral bodies) perilesional edema;
presence of no, focal nodular, annular or diffuse CE, as well as the
occurrence of a syrinx. The evaluation was done independently by one
experienced radiologist (NK) and one instructed post-graduate student
(YM). Inter-observer variability was calculated and for further evaluation
both had to reach consensus.

Study imaging protocol

All patients received an additional high-resolution, three-dimensional T2weighted SPACE sequence as anatomical reference and a study-speciﬁc
DTI sequence using a 3.0T scanner (SIEMENS®, Erlangen, Germany). DTI was
performed using the RESOLVE sequence (Readout Segmentation Of Long
Variable Echo-trains, SIEMENS®) with the following imaging parameters:
axial acquisition, TR 7000 ms, TE 77 ms, Matrix 110 × 110, slice thickness

2.0 mm, resulting resolution 2 × 2 × 2 mm, b values 0 and 1000 s/mm2, 20
diffusion directions [18]. From July 2017 to October 2019 an adapted DTI
protocol had to be used due to scanner updates with modiﬁed parameters:
sagittal acquisition, TR 2600 ms, TE 66 ms, Matrix 110 × 200; slice thickness
2.5 mm, resulting resolution 1 × 1 × 2.5 mm; b values 0 and 2000 s/mm², 40
diffusion directions. Ten patients were measured with this adapted
protocol. Correction for Gibbs artifact, followed by a denoising step was
applied for image acquisition [19, 20].

Evaluation of DTI

The image post-processing was done through the specialized in-house
software pipeline NORA (www.nora-imaging.org) and for tensor calculation
the following open source toolbox was used: https://www.uniklinikfreiburg.de/mr-en/research-groups/diffperf/ﬁbertools.html. For calculation
of the DTI parameters we deﬁned seven regions of interest (ROI) for every
tumor-suspected lesion: cranial normal spinal cord, cranial edema, cranial
lesion margin, central lesion area, caudal lesion margin, caudal edema, and
caudal normal spinal cord. For further analysis we calculated the mean of
the cranial and caudal value, if both anatomical locations were available for
ROI setting. If there was only a cranial or caudal ROI deﬁnable, the single
value was used. Principle of ROI setting is depicted in Fig. 1. Spherical ROI
were applied with a radius of two voxels placed on the fractional
anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefﬁcient (ADC) maps with
corresponding 3D T2-weighted images as anatomical correlation. Within
every ROI, the average FA and ADC values were calculated. All ADC values
are given in 10−3 mm2/s.

Statistics

Data processing and statistical analysis were performed using IBM SPSS
Statistics® (Version 25). The inter-observer reliability for the radiographic
conventional MRI characteristics was determined by Kappa statistics [21].
Normal distribution was assessed by Shapiro–Wilk-test. t-Test for unpaired
samples for normally distributed values and Mann–Whitney U test for nonnormally distributed values were used to compare the different entity
groups. Levene’s test was used to assess the equality of variances. p value
<0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.

RESULTS
Baseline characteristics study population
We prospectively included 40 patients with a mean age of 45.4
(SD 18.3) years. Gender distribution showed 18 male (45.0%) and
22 female (55.0%) patients. Eighteen patients (45.0%) reported
pain and/or showed mild neurological deﬁcits like paresthesia or
slight gait disturbance (mMCS 1 or 2), whereas 14 patients (35.0%)
were severely neurologically deteriorated (mMCS 3–5). Seven
patients (17.5%) with a spinal cord lesion showed only nonspeciﬁc symptoms, like neck pain or dizziness, leading to primary
MRI diagnostics. They are stated as mMCS 0. For the 2-year-old
child, the mMCS could not be determined.
After inclusion into the study and DTI measurement, 26 of all 40
patients received a deﬁnite diagnosis through their clinical
diagnostic work-up or following surgical treatment. Eighteen
patients (45%) had a histological proven SCT, whereof ten patients
(25%) showed an ependymoma and eight patients (20%) another
SCT. In eight patients (20%), an inﬂammatory process could be
detected. Therefore, the left 14 patients (35%) remained with an
indeterminate diagnosis without a speciﬁc treatment, thus
receiving imaging and clinical follow-up examinations. The mean
follow-up time for patients with an indeterminate lesion was 31.4
(SD 28.0) months, whereas the diagnosis remained still unclear for
this whole time period. The clinical course and follow-up time
period of every patient with an indeterminate diagnosis was
heterogeneous and is attached as Supplementary 1.
According to their deﬁnite diagnosis, we grouped our study
population in “spinal cord tumors”, including the two subgroups
“ependymomas” and “other spinal cord tumors”, as well as
“inﬂammation” and “indeterminate”. The baseline parameters for
each group are shown in Table 1.

within the central tumor area for ependymomas and within the edema for other SCTs as well as the ADC values within the central tumor area
for other SCTs. For all other group comparisons t-test for unpaired samples was applied.

Conventional MRI
The predominant location of the intramedullary lesions was the
cervical spine (n = 25, 62.5%), whereof two lesions expanded to
the craniocervical junction and four to the thoracic spine. The
other lesions were located at the thoracic spine (n = 15, 37.5%)
with one tumor expanding to the upper lumbar spine. The
consensus MRI lesion characteristics of both raters for every
patient are shown in Table 2.
The absolute agreement of both raters for all seven evaluated
lesion characteristics in all 40 patients was 83.2% (233 of in total
280 ratings). By consensus reading, the ﬁnal decision was
adjusted predominantly toward the experienced radiologist in
35 of the 47 disagreed cases (74.5%). The absolute agreement
separated for each lesion characteristic and the associated
Kappa values were added as Supplementary 2. The interobserver reliability was “moderate” to “almost perfect” with the
following Kappa (K) values: Space occupation Κ = 0.641 (SD
0.117, p < 0.001), intramedullary position Κ = 0.827 (SD 0.095,
p < 0.001), cysts Κ = 0.744 (SD 0.091, p < 0.001), hemorrhage Κ =
0.630 (SD 0.148, p < 0.001), edema Κ = 0.560 (SD 0.098, p <
0.001), CE Κ = 0.579 (SD 0.101, p < 0.001), syrinx Κ = 0.725 (SD
0.150, p < 0.001) [21].
Diffusion tensor imaging
Because of the heterogeneous lesion location and expansion, the
ROI setting had to be adapted individually, like mentioned within
the methods section. In all patients we could deﬁne a ROI at the
central lesion area and at the lesion margin. But not every patient
showed a perilesional edema or normal spinal cord areas within
the ﬁeld of view. The number of applicable ROI for every patient
group is attached as Supplementary 3.
We separated our DTI parameter evaluation for patients with a
distinct (n = 26) and patients with an indeterminate diagnosis
(n = 14).
For the central lesion area, SCT showed signiﬁcantly lower mean
FA values compared to the inﬂammation group (0.249 (SD 0.106)
vs. 0.457 (SD 0.081), p < 0.001). This signiﬁcant difference
remained at the lesion margin (0.333 (SD 0.128) vs. 0.526 (SD
0.048), p < 0.001). The mean ADC values were signiﬁcantly higher
in SCT at the lesion margin (1.487 (SD 0.273) vs. 1.027 (SD 0.241),
p = 0.001), without reaching statistical signiﬁcance at the central
lesion area (p = 0.129). The perilesional edema and the normal
spinal cord areas showed no signiﬁcant differences for both DTI
parameters.

Spinal Cord (2022) 60:655 – 663

The comparison of the two SCT subgroups revealed no
signiﬁcant differences for all evaluated areas (Fig. 2). Ependymomas showed the lowest mean FA at the central lesion area (0.240
(SD 0.099)) and the lesion margin (0.322 (SD 0.147)) and the
highest mean ADC values for both areas (1.300 (SD 0.502) and
1.528 (SD 0.265)) without reaching statistical signiﬁcance compared to the other SCT (p = 0.237–0.694, Table 3 and Fig. 2). For
the comparison of both SCT subgroups with the inﬂammations,
the differences remained similar to all SCT together (Fig. 2) for the
central and margin lesion areas. For the perilesional edema, a
statistically signiﬁcant difference was only detected for the ADC
between ependymoma and the inﬂammation group (1.600 (SD
0.304) vs. 1.154 (SD 0.282), p = 0.040, Fig. 2) with a marginally nonsigniﬁcant trend for the FA (0.355 (SD 0.134) vs. 0.479 (SD 0.069),
p = 0.081). The normal spinal cord areas showed no signiﬁcant
differences between all groups as expected (Fig. 2).
Some data were not normally distributed, therefore the
following subgroups were compared by Mann–Whitney U test:
FA at the central tumor area for ependymomas and at the edema
for other SCT, as well as ADC values at the central tumor area for
other SCT and patients with indeterminate diagnosis. The average
values were given as mean values for the sake of clarity.
Figure 3 depicts the scatterplots of all 40 evaluated patients for
the FA values within the central lesion area and the lesion margin.
There was a noticeable clustering from lower FA values in
ependymomas to increasing values in other SCT and inﬂammations (from left to right). The depiction of the indeterminate
diagnosis at the right side of the scatterplot (light gray) shows a
wide range of FA values from 0.101 to 0.525 for the central lesion
area and 0.172 to 0.635 for the lesion margin.
DISCUSSION
Aim of this study was to detect a speciﬁc DTI parameter
conﬁguration to separate spinal ependymomas from other SCT
and inﬂammatory diseases. We could demonstrate signiﬁcantly
lower FA and increased ADC values for spinal cord neoplasms
compared to inﬂammatory lesions. Based on our current DTI
measurements, a reliable separation of ependymomas from other
SCT was not feasible.
This is in line with one of our previous publications showing
successful separation of patients with inﬂammatory lesions due to
DTI-based subjective streamline analysis [22]. Inﬂammatory
pathologies presented consistently with normal appearing

streamlines in the region of the intramedullary lesion, whereas
neoplastic lesions showed displaced or disrupted streamlines. The
recent results conﬁrmed the previous data of the subjective
streamline analysis.
Pathological diffusion alterations, depicted through abnormal
DTI values, are known to reﬂect different cellular structures within
neoplastic as well as the surrounding tissue of the spinal cord.
There are some smaller case series showing decreased FA and
elevated ADC values in intramedullary astrocytomas compared to
healthy spinal cord [13, 23, 24]. This reﬂects a disturbed structure
of the normally high anisotropic white matter of the spinal cord
with its parallel orientation of nerve ﬁbers.
The differentiation of the intramedullary tumor entities itself is
still challenging. Maj et al. reported a DTI-based differentiation of
inﬁltrating and non-inﬁltrating SCT in 18 patients [16]. Signiﬁcant
higher FA values were detected for non-inﬁltrating ependymomas
(n = 12) compared to inﬁltrating astrocytic tumors (n = 6) at the
peritumoral margins (0.399 (SD 0.08) vs. 0.304 (SD 0.1), p = 0.007)
and peritumoral edema (0.439 (SD 0.11) vs. 0.350 (SD 0.1), p =
0.029). There was no signiﬁcant FA difference within the tumor
mass itself (0.205 (SD 0.1) vs. 0.228 (SD 0.1), p = 0.470). The ADC
values were signiﬁcantly higher within the tumor mass for noninﬁltrative tumors (1.59 (SD 0.55) vs. 1.12 (SD 0.2), p = 0.016) but
without a signiﬁcant difference for the peritumoral margin or
edema. They postulated higher tumor cellularity in the peritumoral zone of inﬁltrating tumors to be responsible for the FA
decrease. Setzer et al. differentiated 14 intramedullary lesions
preoperatively based on Diffusion Tensor Tractography as
resectable or non-resectable depending on the appearance of
the ﬁber structure at the lesion [14]. Quantitative DTI metrics were
not reported within this work.
In our study, FA values within the tumor mass as well as at the
tumor margin seem to be lowest among ependymomas and to
increase in other tumor types and to be the highest in
inﬂammatory lesions. The scatterplot of the individual FA values
at the central lesion area and lesion margin of all patients (Fig. 3)
shows an increase from left (ependymomas) to right (inﬂammations). There was one outlier (patient No. 8) among the
ependymoma group with a FA > 0.4 (central lesion area) and
FA > 0.5 (lesion margin). Unfortunately, this patient showed an
unclear artifact cranial of the tumor mass (see Supplement 4),
possibly affecting also the distant measured DTI parameters.
Seven of all ten ependymomas showed a FA ≈ 0.2, indicating a
strong disorganized diffusion at the central lesion area. The other
SCT showed FA values from 0.1 (pilocytic astrocytoma and
anaplastic oligoastrocytoma) to 0.43 (low-grade glioma of the
conus medullaris). The patients of the inﬂammation group showed
FA values >0.35 (mean 0.457 (SD 0.081)) within the lesion, nearest
to the values of the normal spinal cord (mean 0.545 (SD 0.106)).
This corresponds to a minor diffusion alteration and seems to be
due to the predominantly acute inﬂammatory response but
basically intact ﬁber structure in those patients [25]. Even at the
lesion margin the mentioned effects continue, whereas the
spreading of the FA values for the ependymomas seems to
increase (Fig. 3). Artifacts or intralesional hemorrhages might
disturb this signal presentation. In summary, there is a trend to
lower FA signals in ependymomas, possibly with a speciﬁc value
around 0.2 at the tumor mass itself.
Liu et al. evaluated the difference between several SCT (n = 12,
a combination of astrocytomas, ependymomas and glioblastomas)
and tumor-like lesions (n = 13, inﬂammatory lesions with multiple
sclerosis, transverse myelitis or sarcoidosis) [26]. The tumor-like
lesions showed higher FA (0.39 (SD 0.111) vs. 0.232 (SD 0.076), p =
0.002) and lower ADC (0.862 (SD 0.166) vs. 1.285 (SD 0.505), p =
0.016) values than the SCT within the lesion, which is in line with
our ﬁndings. Additionally, there was also a clear deterioration of
the diffusion strength compared to normal spinal cord segments.
The baseline values at the normal appearing spinal cord within our

cohort were comparable with values reported in literature and
therefore reliable (FA: mean 0.545 (SD 0.106) and ADC: mean 1.101
(SD 0.360)) [16, 27].
Overall, there are some former reports of a reproducible
differentiation of neoplastic lesions from healthy spinal cord and
inﬂammatory lesions, which could be conﬁrmed throughout our
results. We might postulate, that a primarily unclear tumorsuspected lesion with a FA > 0.4 or ADC ≈ 1.0 is suggestive for an
inﬂammatory disease without indication for surgery or biopsy.
Grounding on the pathophysiology, the inﬂammatory lesions
might have a less strong disarranged diffusion compared to the
normal spinal cord because of the potential integrity of the tissue
structure. This has a relevant clinical impact, because of the noninvasive differentiation of neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions
with their primary conservative treatment. There are still several
reports of spinal cord biopsies in inﬂammatory lesions, like even in
our cohort (No. 19 and 22) [28, 29]. This is a risk for neurological
deterioration and has to be avoided.
There are different areas of interest for the evaluation of DTI
metrics in a tumor-suspected lesion. We detected alterations at all
anatomical sites: the central lesion area as well as at the lesion
margin and the associated edema. Maj et al. showed signiﬁcant
differences at the peritumoral margin and edema for the FA and at
Spinal Cord (2022) 60:655 – 663

the tumor mass for the ADC [16]. For the differentiation of
neoplastic and inﬂammatory lesions, the lesion margin showed
consistently signiﬁcant differences for both parameters, FA and
ADC, whereas at the central lesion area only revealed signiﬁcances
for the FA. Therefore, the margin of the suspected lesion seems to
be the most relevant area for evaluation.
Fourteen of all included patients remained without deﬁnite
diagnosis (“indeterminate”). Due to no (six patients) or minor
neurological deterioration (three patients with mMCS 1 and two
patients with mMCS 2) or declining surgical treatment, these
patients underwent follow-up examinations. The DTI metrics for
this patient group showed values ranging throughout the whole
spectrum as depicted in Fig. 3 in light gray (FA values 0.101–0.525
for the central lesion area and 0.172–0.635 for the lesion margin,
mean (SD) shown in Table 3). We suspect, that correspondingly all
possible entities are reﬂected within this group. Unfortunately, we
received no deﬁnite diagnosis for precise evaluation.
A major limitation, also within our work, is the low incidence of
SCT resulting in a small sample size for mono-centric studies. This
restriction can only be solved by larger multi-center trials or (inter-)
national register studies. Another limitation seems to be the
heterogeneous dimension of the tumor-suspected lesions. Tumors
with a large space occupation or enormous edema might show

M. Hohenhaus et al.

662
more heterogeneous signal clusters than smaller lesions. Side
effects like intratumoral hemorrhages, a large syrinx or even signal
artifacts (like patient No. 8) may affect the lesion characterization.
Additionally, the lesion location could be a relevant attribute.
Lesions in the upper cervical spine might show slightly different
DTI values than in the lower thoracic spine, because of the different
anatomical constitution of the spinal cord. There are reports
concerning diverging normal values between the cervical and
thoracic spine [27]. Besides localization, the widely ranging age of
all included patients (range 2–80 years, mean 45.4 (SD 18.3) years)
can be a confounder too, whereas an age-dependency of DTI
parameters is reported in the literature for measurements of the
healthy spinal cord [30–33]. There are no reports of age-dependent
alterations within tumorous areas so far, but an impact of patients’
age could be not be addressed by our data. In principle, larger ageand gender-matched studies would be preferable, but due to the
rare pathology of SCT this would reduce the evaluable sample size
considerably.
Another limitation of our study is due to the DTI application in
clinical routine. For the conventional evaluation of all spinal cord
lesions, the high-resolution 3D T2 SPACE was used. The
anatomical resolution of Diffusion-weighted MR images is
notoriously not as good as for T1- or T2-weighted sequences,
whereas a precise discrimination of tissue alterations on Diffusionweighted images is limited. This complicates the evaluation of the
DTI parameters when setting the ROI, because of the small
anatomical structures dealing with the spinal cord. In principle, the
highest image resolution would be desirable for anatomical
discrimination as well as for the reduction of partial volume
effects. But in clinical routine, there has to be always the
compromise between the acquisition time of the study imaging,
that must be tolerable for the patient, and an adequate resolution
to address the aimed question. The applied resolution was chosen
similarly to the reports within the literature [14–16, 26]. Another
complicating factor is, that there is no conformity concerning the
most reproducible and reliable ROI size and setting procedure. We
chose a ROI size of two voxels, which was smaller than the
previously described in the literature in order to avoid measuring
surrounding structures to increase precision. The ROI were set
directly at the DTI maps to avoid anatomically distortions. Another
imaging limitation of this evaluation is the change of the MRI
protocol, which was due to scanner updates after the measurement of 30 patients.
At the moment, there is still no radiological technique that
reliably separates the different intramedullary tumor entities. For
the future, we probably need an integration of different imaging
resources with conventional MRI, DTI, MR spectroscopy or new
innovative sequences in combination with international studies or
registries, to gain a better non-invasive differentiation of
intramedullary tumors.

CONCLUSIONS
We conclude, that even though a distinct differentiation of
ependymomas and other SCT was not possible due to objective
DTI metrics, a separation of inﬂammatory lesions was feasible in
our study cohort based on FA and ADC values. This may avoid
unnecessary surgery in patients with unclear intramedullary
tumor-suspected lesions. To achieve better tumor differentiation,
higher case numbers are needed, requiring larger (inter-) national
registry studies.

Abstract
Inflammation is thought to be involved in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder (BP) and metabolic
syndrome. Prior studies evaluated the association between metabolic profiles and cytokines only during
certain mood states instead of their changes during treatment. We enrolled drug-naïve patients with BPII and investigated the correlation between changes in mood symptoms and metabolic indices with
changes in plasma cytokine levels after 12 weeks of pharmacological treatment. Drug-naïve patients (n
= 117) diagnosed with BP-II according to DSM-IV criteria were recruited. Metabolic profiles (choles‐
terol, triglyceride, HbA1C, fasting serum glucose, body mass index (BMI) and plasma cytokines (TNFα, CRP, IL-6, and TGF-β) were measured at baseline and 2, 8, and 12 weeks post-treatment. To adjust
within-subject dependence over repeated assessments, multiple linear regressions with generalized esti‐
mating equation methods were used. Seventy-six (65.0%) patients completed the intervention. Changes
in plasma CRP were significantly associated with changes in BMI (P = 1.7E-7) and triglyceride (P =
0.005) levels. Changes in plasma TGF-β1 were significantly associated with changes in BMI (P = 8.2E6), cholesterol (P = 0.004), and triglyceride (P = 0.006) levels. However, changes in plasma TNF-α and

IL-6 were not associated with changes in any of the metabolic indices. Changes in Hamilton Depres‐
sion Rating Scale scores were significantly associated with changes in IL-6 (P = 0.003) levels; changes
in Young Mania Rating Scale scores were significantly associated with changes in CRP (P = 0.006) and
TNF-α (P = 0.039) levels. Plasma CRP and TGF-β1 levels were positively correlated with several meta‐
bolic indices in BP-II after 12 weeks of pharmacological intervention. We also hypothesize that clinical
symptoms are correlated with certain cytokines. These new findings might be important evidence that
inflammation is the pathophysiology of clinical symptoms and metabolic disturbance in BP-II.

Introduction
Bipolar II disorder (BP-II), defined as recurrent episodes of depression and hypomania, is frequently
misdiagnosed in clinical settings [1]–[4]. It is believed that BP-II is greatly under diagnosed in clinical
practice and lacks in-depth research because BP-II has been regarded as a “milder form of Bipolar I
disorder (BP-I)” [5], [6]. However, long-term follow-ups show that patients with BP-II have a more
chronic course, more mood episodes, more major and minor depressive episodes, and shorter interepisodes, all of which last longer than those of patients with BP-I [7]–[9]. In addition, suicidal risk
seems to be particularly elevated in BP-II [10]. The high rate of suicide in BP-II may be explained by
frequent misdiagnoses of the disorder followed by ineﬀective treatment [11], [12].
Inflammation appears to be involved in the pathophysiology, phenomenology, and treatment response
of BP [13]. Activation of the inflammatory response system and increased activity of the proinflamma‐
tory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) were
found during acute manic and depressive states [14], [15] [16]–[18]. However, whether these phenome‐
na are state-dependent and normalize in remission remains controversial [19], [20]. These discrepancies
may be explained by methodological diﬀerences such as heterogeneity in sample characteristics, sample
size, medication received, and not controlling for known comorbidities [13]. However, an understand‐
ing of an association between inflammation and BP might reveal novel pathophysiology and treatment
options, and it might even benefit investigating using anti-inflammatory medications to treat BP [21],
[22].
Patients with BP have a higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome than do the general population [23]–
[25]. Obesity is more prevalent in BP and is associated with a worse prognosis and with suicide at‐
tempts [26]. Several possible factors might contribute to the high risk of metabolic disturbance in pa‐
tients with BP. Treatment with second-generation antipsychotics and mood stabilizers such as valproate

has been associated with altered lipid profiles [27]–[30]. In addition, dysfunction of the HPA axis, dys‐
regulation of hormones, and neurotransmitters in BP might also contribute to metabolic disturbance
[31]–[34].
It has been hypothesized that the increased risk for obesity in populations with mood disorder is a con‐
sequence of shared pathophysiological pathways. Obesity is proposed as a chronic low-grade proinflam‐
matory state [35]; alterations in CRP and proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6 are com‐
monly reported in obesity [36]–[38]. Increased plasma transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, an antiinflammatory cytokine, was correlated with dyslipidemia in an animal model [39]. Taking these find‐
ings together, the bidirectional relationship between metabolic abnormality and BP may be a conse‐
quence of aberrant inflammatory networks. Clarifying the correlation between inflammatory markers
and the metabolic profile in BP is worth further investigation.
Most studies have evaluated only the association between metabolic disturbance and inflammatory
markers during certain mood states instead of evaluating their changes over a prolonged course of treat‐
ment. In the present study, we enrolled drug-naïve patients with BP-II and measured their plasma cy‐
tokine levels and metabolic indices before and after they had undergone a 12-week pharmacological
intervention. We investigated the correlation between changes in inflammatory markers and metabolic
indices after 12 weeks of treatment. The correlation between changes in these inflammatory markers
and in clinical symptoms was also investigated.

Methods
Ethic Statement
The research protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board for the Protection of Human
Subjects at Tri-Service General Hospital and at National Cheng Kung University Hospital. After the
study protocol had been completely described to the participants, they all signed written informed con‐
sent forms before the trial started and before blood samples were drawn.

Patient selection
This study is a subgroup analysis of a clinical trial (Trial registration: NCT01188148 at https://register.‐
clinicaltrials.gov/). The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as sup‐
porting information; see Checklist S1 and Protocol S1. The original study was a randomized, doubleblind, controlled 12-week trial, aimed to investigate whether treating bipolar II disorder with valproate
(VPA) plus add-on memantine is more eﬀective than VPA alone (Lee et al., unpublished). The original
study protocol was to examine 4 subgroups: VPA + placebo, VPA + memantine, VPA + placebo +
cognitive behavioral group therapy, VPA + memantine + cognitive behavioral group therapy. However,

because of staﬀ shortage, we were unable to perform cognitive behavioral group therapy. Therefore,
only the two groups undergoing pharmacotherapy were included in for the entire 12-week study period.
Because the aim of the current study was to investigate the association between inflammation and meta‐
bolic profiles, we used only patients from the placebo group for this subgroup analysis to avoid the in‐
fluence of add-on memantine, which is not a routinely used medication in the treatment of bipolar II
disorder. In this way, the result would be more applicable to daily practice.
The study population was recruited from outpatient and inpatient settings in Tri-Service General Hospi‐
tal in Taipei and at National Cheng Kung University Hospital in Tainan, Taiwan. The inclusion criteria
were: a) Patients with BP-II initially evaluated in an interview by an attending psychiatrist and fol‐
lowed-up with a more detailed interview with a clinical psychologist using the Chinese Version of the
Modified Schedule of Aﬀective Disorder and Schizophrenia-Life Time (SADS-L) [40], which has good
inter-rater reliability [41], to determine Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSMIV) diagnoses; b)Han Chinese; c) between 18 and 65 years old. The exclusion criteria were: 1) a major
mental illness, borderline personality disorder, drug dependence, or a cognitive disorder other than BPII; 2) previous use of any psychotropic agent; 3) taking any anti-inflammatory medication before or dur‐
ing the trial period.
Although DSM-IV-TR [42] criteria require a minimum duration of 4 days of hypomania, current epi‐
demiologic data samples [2], [7], [43]–[46] suggest that a 2-day duration is more prevalent in the com‐
munity; therefore, we used the 2-day minimum for hypomania when diagnosing BP-II.

Study Design
After they had been enrolled in this study, the patients were given open-label valproic acid (500 mg and
1000 mg daily [50–100 μg/ml in plasma]). Only limited use of benzodiazepines (lorazepam; up to 8mg/day) or fluoxetine (up to 20 mg/day) was allowed as concomitant medication for insomnia, agita‐
tion, or irritability. The doses were adjusted based on each patient's clinical manifestations and toler‐
ance. In case of side-eﬀect intolerance or clinical worsening, the patients were withdrawn earlier. The
severity of mood symptoms was assessed using the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) [47] and the
Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) [48], [49]. Clinical ratings were done by research psychia‐
trists who were trained and experienced in using the rating scales. Symptom severity was assessed at
baseline and at 2, 8, and 12 weeks. After the initiation of pharmacological treatment, BMI, lipid profile
(cholesterol, triglyceride, high density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL)), fasting
serum glucose level, and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) were measured at baseline and at each vis‐
it when symptom severity was assessed.
Ten milliliters of whole blood was withdrawn from the antecubital vein of each patient. Plasma was
isolated from the whole blood after it had been centrifuged at 3000 g for 15 min at 4°C, and then it was
immediately stored at −80°C. Cytokine levels were quantified using an antibody pair assay system

(Flexia; BioSource Intl., Camarillo, CA). Sample processing and data analysis were done according to
the manufacturer's instructions. The immunological parameters–CRP, TNF-α, TGF-β, and IL-6–were
measured at baseline and at each visit when symptom severity was assessed.

Statistical Analysis
SPSS 18 for Windows was used for statistical computations. Significance was set at P<0.05. Repeated
measurements were used to investigate the association of plasma cytokine levels with the metabolic
profile (BMI, lipid profile, fasting serum glucose level, and HbA1C) and symptom severity before and
after pharmacological treatment. Because all cytokine levels were distributed erratically and showed a
significant level of positive skew (Table 1), arithmetic transformations were used to produce approxi‐
mately normal distributions for further analysis; log (x+1) was used for cytokine levels. To evaluate the
possible correlations of the plasma cytokines with the metabolic profile (BMI, lipid profile, fasting
serum glucose level, and HbA1C) and symptom severity, the multiple linear regression model was
used. The statistical method, the generalized estimating equation (GEE) [50], was set up for multiple
linear regression in repeated-measures studies which can accommodate randomly missing data [51]. In
the current study, GEE analysis was used to investigate the correlations of the plasma cytokines (depen‐
dent variables) with the metabolic profile and symptom severity (all parameters of which were indepen‐
dent variables); time eﬀects (treatment period from baseline to week 12), gender and age were con‐
trolled for. To adjust for multiple comparisons, a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons was
done.

Results
The trial ran from 1st August, 2008 to 31st July, 2012. The first patient was recruited on 2009/8/25 while
the last enrolled patient finished on 2012/5/30. One hundred seventeen patients were recruited. All pa‐
tients with BP-II were first diagnosed, and that they had no history of taking mood stabilizers or an‐
tipsychotics was verified.

At baseline, 117 patients were assessed. One hundred and three patients were assessed when the trial
proceeded to week 2. At week 8, eighty patients were assessed. In the end, seventy-six (65.0%) of the
117 patients completed the 12-week pharmacological treatment and metabolic profile survey (Figure 1)
The demographic and clinical characteristics, baseline and endpoint HDRS and YMRS scores, meta‐
bolic profiles, and plasma cytokine levels of the patients are shown in Table 1.

Figure 1
Consort flow chart of recruitment.

Correlation analysis was done on all patients in the placebo group. Changes in plasma CRP levels were
significantly associated with changes in BMI (P = 1.7E-7) and triglyceride (P = 0.005) levels (Table 2).
However, changes in plasma CRP levels were not associated with changes in cholesterol, HDL, LDL, or
HbA1C levels. Changes in plasma TGF-β1 levels were significantly associated with changes in BMI (P
= 8.2E-6), cholesterol (P = 0.004), and triglyceride (P = 0.006) levels, but not with the changes in HDL,
LDL, or HbA1C levels. Changes in plasma TNF-α and IL-6 levels were not associated with any of the
changes in metabolic indices after the 12-week treatment (Table 2). Changes in HDRS scores were sig‐
nificantly associated with changes in IL-6 (P = 0.003) levels. In addition, the changes in YMRS scores

were significantly associated with changes in CRP (P = 0.006) and TNF-α (P = 0.039) levels (Table 2).
However, if we correct for multiple comparisons, only the associations between CRP and TGF-α1 with
BMI (both P<0.001) remain significant.

The study had a power of approximately 0.33 to detect a small eﬀect, and 0.99 to detect medium and
large eﬀects for multiple regression analysis (N = 117). In this power analysis, the eﬀect-size conven‐
tions were determined according to Buchner et al. [52] as follows: small eﬀect size = 0.02, medium ef‐
fect size = 0.15, large eﬀect size = 0.35 for the multiple regression model (alpha = 0.05).

Discussion
We found an association between changes in BMI and CRP, one of the markers of low-grade inflamma‐
tion. This might mean that elevated levels of CRP are also indicators of a relative increase in BMI. The
positive association between CRP and BMI is widely known [54]–[57] in healthy controls and other
populations (diabetes, hypertension). A significant association between high CRP and prevalence of
metabolic syndrome has been reported [58]. Another study [59] also reported that elevated levels of
CRP in adulthood are related to changes in BMI between childhood and adulthood [59]. Our findings
about the positive association between the longitudinal changes in BMI and CRP support a positive as‐
sociation of BMI and CRP in drug naïve patients with BP-II. In addition, we also report a possible posi‐
tive association of change in CRP and triglyceride levels which did not survive the correction of multi‐
ple comparisons. Whether this finding supports past studies [60]–[62] that suggest the probable in‐
volvement of CRP with metabolic syndrome and obesity still requires further study.
CRP is an acute-phase reactant synthesized in the liver largely in response to proinflammatory cy‐
tokines. Adipose tissue can produce proinflammatory cytokines that subsequently increase CRP pro‐
duction [63]. CRP does not cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in trace amounts; however, during sys‐
temic inflammation and obesity, CRP may increase paracellular permeability of the BBB and impair
BBB function [64]. In addition, the level of CRP may indicate the status of inflammation in the brain,
which might decrease neurotrophic support and lead to brain dysfunction [65]; such dysfunction is also
associated with the pathogenesis of BP. Our findings support the hypothesis that inflammation is the
common underlying pathogenesis for the frequently comorbid BP and metabolic disturbances.
The current study also provided initial evidence of a positive correlation between TGF-β1 and and
BMI. TGF-β1 induces plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) synthesis and is associated with BMI
in humans [66], [67]. However, our findings of the positive correlation between TGF-β and triglyc‐
erides and cholesterol did not survive the correction of a multiple comparison. TGF-β1 is a potent antiinflammatory cytokine that regulates various physiological processes, including cell proliferation, cell
diﬀerentiation, extracellular matrix synthesis, and the immune response. It has been implicated in the
pathogenesis of autoimmune disease, carcinogenesis, and cardiovascular disease [68]–[70]. Evidence
indicates that TGF-β is implicated in significantly higher cardiovascular disease plasma levels of acti‐
vated TGF-β in patients with coronary heart disease [71]. The correlation between hypercholes‐
terolemia and TGF-β1 has been hypothesized to be caused by activation of the innate immune response,
inflammation, and fibrosis [39].Our findings confirmed a positive association between BMI and in‐
creased plasma TGF-β1in BP-II. Combining the positive association of plasma CRP and TGF-β1 with
BMI and possibly dyslipidemia, we propose that the positive association is a result of activation of the
immune response, which warrants study of the mechanisms involved.

However, we found no significant association of the metabolic profile with plasma IL-6 and TNF-α lev‐
els, as was previously reported [56], [72]. This inconsistency may be explained by diﬀerent study de‐
signs and the study participants in the current study. We analyzed the association of changes in meta‐
bolic profiles and inflammatory factors instead of cross-sectional correlations, as was done in previous
studies. In addition, all participants in the current study were drug naïve patients with BP-II undergoing
initial short-term pharmacological intervention. The long-term metabolic influences and their associa‐
tion with the inflammatory factors in our patients require additionalfollow-up and investigation.
In treating neuropsychiatric disorders, being able to identify and quantify peripheral biomarkers for di‐
agnosis or monitoring treatment responses still remains a clinical goal. We reported that the decreases
in HDRS scores over the study period were associated with decreases in IL-6 levels, and that the de‐
creases in YMRS scores were associated with the decreases in CRP and TNF-α levels. However, these
findings did not survive correction for multiple comparisons. Based on our findings, we propose that
changes the levels of plasma cytokines may be associated with the severity of mood symptoms in pa‐
tients with BP-II in a prolonged course of treatment instead of in a cross-sectional study. Other studies
[15], [17] have suggested that changes in proinflammatory cytokines may be related to the pathophysi‐
ology of BP and to the response to pharmacological treatment. A change in IL-6 levels according to
mood state is one of the most consistent findings in BP [15], [16]. Our finding supports a report [73]
that IL-6 was positively correlated with HDRS scores. In addition, our data suggest that changes plas‐
ma CRP may be associated with the severity of manic symptoms, which agrees with Dickerson et al.
[14], who said that mania symptoms but not HDRS scores were associated with the increased produc‐
tion of CRP. The possible association between cytokines and clinical symptoms found in the current
study requires additional study to confirm. In addition, whether the combination of these cytokines may
be used as biomarkers for the severity of BP-II still requires further investigation using a larger sample
size.
Our study has some limitations. First, we measured plasma cytokines in the current study because pre‐
vious studies suggested that changes in peripheral cytokine expression levels may partially reflect the
changes in peripheral levels. However, we were unable to draw a definitive conclusion about this hy‐
pothesis [74]. Second, except for the correlation between changes in CRP and TNF-α with changes in
BMI, most of our positive findings did not survive correction for multiple testing. Further studies with
larger samples are needed to verify our results. To achieve enough power (0.8) for detection of small
eﬀect (0.02), we would need a target size around N = 395. Third, it is possible that the medication per‐
mitted in the study obscured the mood correlation between cytokines and metabolic indices. Although
we tried to limit concomitant treatment medication to only three drugs, our results should still be taken
with caution. Fourth, the 2-day duration for hypomania used in the current study is not widely accepted.
The positive finding in the current study may not apply to patients with BP-II diagnosed according to
the DSM-IV-TR criteria of the 4-day duration for hypomania. Fifth, we did not control for the baseline
severity of patients. Unlike past studies that focused on only one pole of the mood spectrum, we as‐
sessed both the YMRS and HDRS scores for subsyndromal manic symptoms that were presented in
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3695222/

over half of bipolar depressive episodes yet frequently not assessed [75]. By evaluating symptoms on
both poles of the mood spectrum, our clinical evaluation is more comprehensive, which may better re‐
flect the association of cytokines and the symptoms of BP. Finally, our study focused only on the meta‐
bolic influences after short-term pharmacological intervention. The long-term metabolic influences in
our patients require additional follow-up and investigation.
In conclusion, our study provides initial evidence of a positive correlation between plasma CRP and
TGF-β1 levels and BMI in drug-naïve patients with BP-II after 12 weeks of pharmacological interven‐
tion. The specific roles of cytokines in regulating and maintaining peripheral metabolic health require
additional investigation. We also hypothesize that clinical symptoms are correlated with certain cy‐
tokines. Whether these cytokines can be used as biomarker of BP-II warrants additional studies. We
expect that knowledge of the function of plasma cytokines in metabolic disturbances will benefit the
development of novel therapies to modify cytokine levels in order to control both clinical symptoms
and metabolic disturbances in BP-II.

Markers for sepsis diagnosis in the forensic setting: state of the art
Cristian Palmiere and Marc Augsburger

Abstract
Reliable diagnoses of sepsis remain challenging in forensic pathology routine despite improved meth‐
ods of sample collection and extensive biochemical and immunohistochemical investigations. Macro‐
scopic findings may be elusive and have an infectious or non-infectious origin. Blood culture results can
be diﬃcult to interpret due to postmortem contamination or bacterial translocation. Lastly, peripheral
and cardiac blood may be unavailable during autopsy. Procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, and inter‐
leukin-6 can be measured in biological fluids collected during autopsy and may be used as in clinical
practice for diagnostic purposes. However, concentrations of these parameters may be increased due to
etiologies other than bacterial infections, indicating that a combination of biomarkers could more eﬀec‐
tively discriminate non-infectious from infectious inflammations. In this article, we propose a review of
the literature pertaining to the diagnostic performance of classical and novel biomarkers of inflamma‐
tion and bacterial infection in the forensic setting.

Worldwide, sepsis and its sequels are still a common cause of acute illness and death in patients with
community-acquired and nosocomial infections (1). Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) is
common in critical cases of severe sepsis and a primary cause of death (2). The American College of
Chest Physicians and the Society of Critical Care Medicine Consensus Conference (Northbrook, IL,
USA; August 1991) defined sepsis as a systemic inflammation response caused by infection (1,3,4).

However, in the early stages of the process, the source of infection may be unclear and the related sys‐
temic response indistinguishable from non-infectious disease. Consequently, diagnosis may be missed
or delayed, posing a serious concern since strong evidence associates early treatment with greater clini‐
cal success (5,6). At present, there is no ideal, clinical gold standard for the diagnosis of sepsis, as mi‐
crobiology is not sensitive enough and laboratory tests unspecific for use as a reference standard (1,2,5).
Bacteremia is identified in only a portion of patients with sepsis, also depending on previous antibiotic
treatment. Culture-negative patients accounted for percentages ranging from 25% to 48% of all septic
cases in a series of clinical studies performed in North America, Europe, and Asia (1,7).
Early clinical signs, such as fever, tachycardia, and leukocitosis, are usually unspecific and overlap with
signs of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) of non-infectious origin. More specific signs
of sepsis, such as arterial hypotension, thrombocytopenia, and increased lactate concentration, often
indicate progression to organ dysfunction (1,8).
Though C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin are currently used as clinical indicators of inflam‐
mation and infection, several other biochemical markers have been investigated for their ability to detect
sepsis in an early, reversible phase (1,3). Nonetheless, identification of an ideal biomarker (or panel of
biomarkers) capable of making a clear distinction between sepsis and SIRS is imperative (2).
Reliable diagnoses of sepsis remain challenging in the forensic field, despite improved methods of col‐
lecting blood and tissue samples for postmortem bacteriology and extensive research in biochemical
and immunohistochemical investigations. There are a myriad of reasons for this diﬃculty in diagnosis,
such as the fact that forensic pathologists rarely have full access to medical records before autopsy is
performed. Furthermore, macroscopic findings (myocardial ischemia, pulmonary edema, hypoxic liver
damage, mesenteric ischemia, gastrointestinal hemorrhages, spleen infarction, kidney ischemia, and
brain edema) and histological observations may be elusive or non-specific and have an infectious or
non-infectious origin. In addition, blood culture results can be diﬃcult to interpret due to contamination
during sampling procedures or bacterial translocation. Postmortem samples might also prove insuﬃ‐
cient, unavailable, or absent during autopsy, especially in infant autopsy. Procalcitonin, CRP, and inter‐
leukin-6 can be measured in biological fluids collected during autopsy and may be used as in clinical
practice for diagnostic purposes. However, the concentrations of these parameters can be increased due
to etiologies other than bacterial infections. Hence, as in the clinical field, in recent years other labora‐
tory parameters have been investigated in order to define the most suitable biomarker (or combination
of biomarkers) that might more eﬀectively discriminate non-infectious from infectious inflammations
(9-15).
The identification of reliable markers of sepsis in the forensic setting is, however, more diﬃcult than in
the clinical field. Indeed, biochemical profiles after death may show considerable variations consequent
to various factors including survival time, molecule leakage from necrotic or damaged cells due to

rapid cell membrane breakdown, molecule redistribution dependent on concentration gradients, and
molecule denaturation. All these factors therefore limit the application of postmortem biochemistry to
relatively stable markers and only some, specific biological fluids (16-18). The aim of this article is to
propose a review of the literature pertaining to the diagnostic performance of classical and novel bio‐
markers of sepsis in forensic pathology routine.

Procalcitonin
High serum procalcitonin concentrations were first described in children with severe bacterial infec‐
tions by Assicot et al (19), and were suggested as a specific marker for bacterial infection. Procalci‐
tonin, the precursor of the hormone calcitonin, is a glycoprotein consisting of 116 amino acids with a
molecular weight of 13 kDa. Gene products transcribed from the CALC-I gene (located on the short
arm of the human chromosome 11) represent a large array of related proteins including calcitonin generelated peptide, amyllin, adrenomedullin, and calcitonin (calcitonin family) that are restricted to neu‐
roendocrine cells of the thyroid under normal metabolic conditions. Only one of these peptides, procal‐
citonin, seems to play a pivotal role in the host response to microbial infections. Procalcitonin is pro‐
duced from the common precursor, pre-procalcitonin, which consists of 141 amino acid residues by
removal of 25 amino acids from the N-terminus. Procalcitonin is made up of a centrally placed calci‐
tonin (a 32-amino acid peptide) and two flanking peptides, N-terminal region (a 57-amino acid pep‐
tide), and katalcin (a 21-amino acid peptide). Regular enzymatic processing and further cleavage in the
C-cells of the thyroid gland result in the production of mature procalcitonin. In the absence of infection,
the extra-thyroid transcription of the CALC-I gene is suppressed. However, during bacterial infections,
pre-procalcitonin mRNA is ubiquitously expressed in various extra-thyroid neuroendocrine tissues and
non-neuroendocrine parenchymal cells throughout the body. Consequently, under septic circumstances,
procalcitonin is released into the bloodstream by a continuous constitutive pathway. Elevated concen‐
trations of procalcitonin during severe bacterial infections are commonly observed in patients who had
already undergone total thyroidectomy. In patients with sepsis, non-neuroendocrine parenchymal cells
are stimulated to produce and secrete large amounts of procalcitonin. However, these lack the posttranslational capacity of neuroendocrine cells to biosynthesize mature calcitonin hormone from procal‐
citonin. A significant increase in calcitonin during sepsis therefore rarely occurs. Though hepatocytes
may produce procalcitonin, it is still debated whether the liver and splancnic area produce procalcitonin
during infections (3,8,20-25).
Systemic activation of immunocompetent cells in response to microorganisms or microbial endotoxin
induces inflammatory cytokine release at the infection site. This is the pivotal mechanism in the patho‐
genesis of the sepsis cascade. Even though procalcitonin is not produced by circulating blood cells, its
synthesis seems to be closely dependent on the cytokines involved in initiating the inflammatory cas‐
cade. Procalcitonin can be detected after 3-4 hours in response to bacterial endotoxins and peaks at 6-8
hours with a half-life of approximately 24-30 hours (8,20-22).

In healthy individuals, all the procalcitonin produced in C-cells is converted to calcitonin, so that circu‐
lating procalcitonin concentrations are below detection levels of 0.1 ng/mL (0.1 μg/L). In patients with
sepsis, procalcitonin concentration may increase up to 5000 to 10 000 times with calcitonin still in the
reference range. No enzymes in blood can break down the procalcitonin circulating molecule (8,20,22).
The physiologic role of procalcitonin is not yet completely understood. Bacterial endotoxins are the
most potent stimulators of procalcitonin release, though gram-positive infections may also induce its
production. Apart from bacterial infections, various situations of tissue damage in non-infected patients
such as prolonged cardiogenic shock, major surgery, severe trauma, or burns, may induce increases in
blood procalcitonin concentrations. However, blood levels observed under these conditions are usually
not as high as those in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. Hence, in cases of trauma or exten‐
sive surgery, increased level persistence as well as secondary procalcitonin increases at a later time may
herald the onset of infectious complications. Local viral infections do not induce increased procalci‐
tonin levels, whereas systemic viral infections may determine levels as high as those noted in bacterial
infections. Systemic fungal infections may be characterized by increased procalcitonin levels, though
concentrations tend to be lower than those in patients with bacterial infections. Conversely, infections
by the malaria parasite often lead to very high serum procalcitonin levels (8,20,23).
Procalcitonin determination for the postmortem diagnosis of sepsis in the realm of forensic pathology
was originally proposed by Tsokos et al (26). These authors measured procalcitonin concentrations in
postmortem serum obtained from septic and control cases and compared antemortem and postmortem
procalcitonin values in septic cases. They observed increased procalcitonin levels in all septic cases and
normal concentrations in most control cases. They also observed a postmortem decrease in procalci‐
tonin values compared to antemortem levels, suggesting that the postmortem measurement of this
marker seems reasonable until at least 140 hours after death. These authors concluded that increased
procalcitonin levels could be considered a reliable diagnostic tool for the postmortem diagnosis of sep‐
sis. Furthermore, they proposed at least two positive postmortem procalcitonin values at diﬀerent post‐
mortem intervals in order to better estimate the most probable procalcitonin level at the time of death
by using linear regression analysis.
Vitreous, pericardial, and cerebrospinal fluid procalcitonin levels in septic and control cases were inves‐
tigated by Schrag et al (10,27), who reported promising results with vitreous and pericardial fluid pro‐
calcitonin concentrations in septic cases. Bode-Jänisch et al (28) measured procalcitonin concentrations
in postmortem serum obtained from septic and control cases and compared postmortem levels to ante‐
mortem procalcitonin concentrations when available. The results confirmed the stability of procalci‐
tonin in postmortem samples and the reliability of this biomarker in the postmortem diagnosis of bacte‐
rial sepsis.

CRP, named for its capacity to precipitate the somatic C-polysaccharide of Streptococcus pneumoniae,
was the first, acute-phase protein to be described. It is a systemic marker of inflammation and tissue
damage, widely used in the diagnosis and management of various clinical conditions. The acute-phase
response comprises the nonspecific physiological and biochemical responses of endothermic animals to
most forms of tissue damage, infection, inflammation, and malignant neoplasia. In particular, the syn‐
thesis of numerous proteins is rapidly up-regulated, mainly in hepatocytes, under the control of cy‐
tokines originating at the site of tissue damage. The human CRP molecule is composed of five identical
non-glycosylated polypeptide subunits, each containing 206 amino acid residues. In healthy young
adults, the median concentration of CRP is 0.8 mg/L, the 90th percentile is 3.0 mg/L, and the 99th per‐
centile is 10 mg/L, but, following an acute-phase stimulus, values may increase to more than 500 mg/L,
hence 10 000 times. Plasma CRP is produced only by hepatocytes, predominantly under transcriptional
control of IL-6, although other sites of local CRP synthesis and possibly secretion have been suggested.
De novo hepatic synthesis starts very rapidly after a single stimulus, with concentrations rising above 5
mg/L by about 4 to 6 hours and peaking around 24 to 48 hours. CRP plasma half-life is about 19 hours
and is constant under all conditions of health and disease, so that the sole determinant of circulating
CRP concentration is the synthesis rate, which thus directly reflects the intensity of the pathological
process(es) stimulating its production (3,29-31).
CRP levels remain elevated during the acute response phase. When the stimulus for increased produc‐
tion completely ceases, the circulating CRP concentration falls rapidly and returns to within reference
values when tissue damage is resolved. Due to its rapid response, short half-life, and high magnitude of
increase, CRP is a useful indicator of the acute phase response in several situations. These may include
infections (bacterial, viral, fungal, and mycobacterial), inflammatory diseases, necrosis (myocardial
infarction, pancreatitis), trauma, and malignancy. In most, though not all, diseases, the circulating value
of CRP reflects ongoing inflammation and/or tissue damage much more accurately than do other labo‐
ratory parameters of the acute-phase response. Acute-phase CRP values show no diurnal variation and
are unaﬀected by eating. Liver failure impairs CRP production, but no other intercurrent pathologies
and very few drugs reduce CRP values unless they also aﬀect the underlying pathology providing the
acute-phase stimulus. CRP concentration is thus a very useful, nonspecific biochemical marker of in‐
flammation as well as an important measurement that may contribute to determining disease severity
and progression (30,31).
In the forensic field, the diagnostic application of CRP determination was originally proposed by Lauri‐
er et al (32). These authors measured CRP values in postmortem serum and pericardial fluid in a series
of 26 forensic autopsies that were selected based on agony duration (long and short agonies). The re‐
sults of this study showed statistically significant increases in CRP levels in both postmortem serum
and pericardial fluid in long agonies. The authors attributed this result to agonal pericarditis possibly
resulting from agonal myocardial necrosis.

Further studies focusing on CRP levels in postmortem samples have been performed by several other
research teams (10,27,29,33-38). Uhlin-Hansen (33), Astrup and Thomsen (37), and Tsokos et al (34)
compared antemortem and postmortem CRP levels and observed increased concentrations of this mark‐
er in septic cases, reflecting the existence of ongoing inflammatory processes at the time of death.
These authors also found that antemortem CRP levels were higher than postmortem concentrations,
likely suggesting molecule proteolysis due to decompositional changes along with irrelevant post‐
mortem molecule release from hepatocytes in the early postmortem period. Maeda et al (35) found low
CRP levels in some infantile and elderly cases of pneumonia that were postulated as age-dependent,
low inflammatory responses. Astrup and Thomsen (37) observed that CRP levels in postmortem serum
stored at 5°C were stable for several weeks. CRP levels measured in liver samples (collected from the
central part of the right lobe), though less stable, correlated well with postmortem serum samples.

Interleukin-6
Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a multifunctional, proinflammatory cytokine with pleiotropic expressions pro‐
duced by a wide variety of cell types (leukocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells) in the early phase of
inflammation. It is a 26 kDa protein that modulates a variety of functions and has a key role in the
acute-phase inflammatory response, being the primary determinant of hepatic CRP production. In addi‐
tion to this role, IL-6 is important in specific immunologic response development, including activated B
cell diﬀerentiation, culminating in the production of immunoglobulin (34,39-44).
IL-6 is normally not detected in the serum of healthy young individuals unless there is trauma, infec‐
tion, or some other stress. Under these circumstances, IL-6 is rapidly expressed and contributes to a
cascade of events typical of inflammation. These include leukocytosis, lymphocyte activation, and
acute-phase protein synthesis as well as a general catabolic shift in metabolic pathways (39).
IL-6 plays a central role in the pathogenesis of sepsis. Numerous clinical studies have demonstrated
consistently increased IL-6 values in both adult and pediatric septic populations. Serum levels above
1000 pg/mL have been shown to predict sepsis-related death in adult patients (3).
Tsokos et al (34) investigated IL-6 levels in the postmortem serum of a series of sepsis and control cas‐
es, comparing antemortem and postmortem levels. They observed high (>1.000 pg/mL) values in most
individuals included in the sepsis group as well as a notable increase in IL-6 concentration in post‐
mortem serum compared with IL-6 levels in antemortem samples. According to the authors, this in‐
crease correlated well with the interval after death and suggested molecule release from cells storing
IL-6 due to autolysis and decompositional changes.

Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is secreted from activated T cells in several immunologic processes and is the ma‐
jor growth factor for T-lymphocytes. IL-2 acts by binding with a membrane IL-2 receptor (IL-2R,
CD25), which is widely expressed by many leukocytes that include activated B cells, monocytes,
eosinophil granulocytes, and natural killer cells. Early in the activation process, T cells express IL-2R,
which consists of three subunits (α, β, γ) encoded by diﬀerent genes. The combination of IL-2Rβ and γ
can bind IL-2. However, the expression of all three subunits is required for the high aﬃnity state. In
situations where a high expression of membrane IL-2R occurs, the subunit α (IL-2Rα, sIL-2R or
sCD25) is shed from the cell surface by proteolytic cleavage and released into the circulation. sIL-2R
release was found to be proportional to its membrane bound-expression, and its determination was
therefore proposed as a useful, indirect marker of T- cell activation in several immunologic situations
including various chronic autoimmune diseases, neoplastic disorders, acute graft-vs-host disease,
chronic liver diseases, and sepsis (45-48).
Reichelt et al (49) investigated sIL-2R in the postmortem serum of a series of sepsis and control cases,
comparing antemortem and postmortem levels. They observed increased (>1.000 U/mL) levels in all
individuals included in the sepsis group and values below the reference limit in most control cases. An‐
temortem levels were generally higher than postmortem concentrations. Moreover, using linear regres‐
sion analysis, sIL-2R levels calculated for the time of death correlated well with the levels measured in
antemortem samples.

Lipopolysaccharide binding protein
Innate immunity is the first line of defense against microbial infections. Host organism responses are
activated when microbial components are recognized by a variety of pathogen sensors, stimulating the
host defense eﬀector system by rapidly triggering proinflammatory processes. Among microbial com‐
ponents, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), lipo-oligosaccharides (LOS), and their bioactive portion, lipodisac‐
charide lipid A are commonly defined as endotoxins. These are potent immune response stimulants and
even small diﬀerences in LPS structure can have a great influence on host immune responses. The in‐
duction of inflammatory responses by endotoxins is achieved by the coordinated, sequential action of
four principal endotoxin-binding proteins: LBP (LPS-binding protein), CD14, toll-like receptor 4
(TLR4), and MD-2 (myeloid diﬀerentiation protein), herein further discussed (50).
LBP was first described in 1990. It is a 58-kDa glycoprotein mainly synthesized in the liver, which is
released into circulation as a type I acute-phase reactant. Reference plasma level ranges from 5 to 15
µg/mL. LBP levels peak shortly after bacteremia or endotoxemia, and remain increased for up to 72
hours later (8,51).
LBP interacts with endotoxin-rich bacterial membranes and purified endotoxin aggregates, catalyzing
endotoxin monomer extraction and transfer to CD14, which in turn transfers endotoxin monomers to
MD-2 and to MD-2–TLR4 complex. The transfer of LPS from CD14 to MD-2, coupled with the associ‐

ation of MD-2 to TLR4, is required for downstream signaling and initiation of the intracellular signal
cascade that culminates in transcription factor translocation to the nucleus and cytokine biosynthesis.
Some of these, specifically IL-6, in turn induce the synthesis of acute-phase proteins in the liver
(50-55).
Forensic use of LBP was investigated by Reichelt et al (49) in a series of sepsis-related deaths and con‐
trol subjects. LBP levels were above 10 µg/mL (reference limit in healthy subjects) in serum samples
obtained prior to death and postmortem serum samples obtained during autopsy in all septic cases. A
notable decrease in LBP levels was observed in the sepsis group, with concentrations still measurable
up to 48 hours after death. A less marked decrease in LBP levels was also noted in the control cases.
According to the authors, the decrease in postmortem serum LBP levels correlated well with the inter‐
val after death in both studied groups and suggested molecule proteolysis due to decompositional
changes along with irrelevant postmortem molecule release from hepatocytes in the early postmortem
period. The authors concluded that increased LBP levels could be considered a reliable diagnostic tool
for the postmortem diagnosis of sepsis. They proposed at least two measurements at diﬀerent post‐
mortem intervals in order to better estimate the most probable LBP levels at the time of death by using
linear regression analysis.
Augsburger et al (56) compared procalcitonin and LBP values in postmortem serum and pericardial
fluid in a series of sepsis-related cases and control subjects. They observed increased (>10 µg/mL) val‐
ues in most septic cases and reference (<10 µg/mL) levels in most control cases, thereby confirming a
high diagnostic accuracy of LBP in identifying sepsis-related deaths. No associations were found be‐
tween postmortem serum and pericardial fluid LBP levels in either the septic or control cases.

sCD14-ST
CD14, the high-aﬃnity receptor for LPS-LBP complexes, is a 55-kDa glycosylphosphatidylinositolanchored protein lacking a cytoplasmic domain. CD14 can only bind LPS in the presence of LBP and,
although LPS is considered its main ligand, CD14 also recognizes other microbial constituents, includ‐
ing the proteoglycans of Gram-positive bacteria. CD14 is constitutively expressed in most innate im‐
mune response cells and exists either in an anchored membrane form (mCD14) or in a circulating solu‐
ble form (sCD14). The latter is a 43-53 kD glycoprotein that derives from either protease-mediated
membrane CD14 shedding or liver synthesis as a type II acute-phase reactant. During inflammation,
plasma protease activity generates soluble CD14 fragments: one of these is a 13-kDa truncated N-ter‐
minal fragment of 64 amino acid residues called sCD14 subtype (sCD14-ST) or presepsin
(50-55,57-63).
By facilitating binding to the CD14 cell membrane molecules, LBP enhances the sensitivity of mono‐
cytes and granulocytes to LPS, whereas the soluble form of CD14 mediates LPS activation of CD14negative cells (53).

2/19/24, 11:18 AM

sCD14-ST is normally present in very low concentrations in the serum of healthy individuals and has
recently been suggested as a marker for the diagnosis of sepsis. Indeed, preliminary studies have indi‐
cated that presepsin values significantly diﬀer in healthy individuals, in patients with local infection,
SIRS, sepsis or severe sepsis (57-63).
In the forensic setting, increased postmortem serum sCD14-ST levels have been found in a series of
sepsis-related deaths using cutoﬀ values ranging from 600 to 1200 pg/mL. Though postmortem serum
sCD14-ST levels, individually considered, failed to provide better sensitivity and specificity than pro‐
calcitonin in detecting sepsis cases, the combined determination of procalcitonin and sCD14-ST in par‐
allel was proposed as useful in improving the diagnostic performance of each biomarker individually
considered in situations with elusive, preliminary findings (64).

Soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1
Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells type 1 (TREM-1) is a recently discovered member of
the immunoglobulin superfamily engaged as a cell membrane receptor on the myeloid cell family.
TREM-1 expression on monocyte and macrophage surfaces was shown to be markedly up-regulated in
human biological fluids as well as tissues infected by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The
functional significance of TREM-1 was discovered when it was observed that the blockade of TREM-1
signaling protects mice from the lethal eﬀects of lipopolysaccharide-induced septic shock. Moreover,
up-regulation of cell-surface TREM-1 expression was shown to result in marked plasma elevation of
the soluble form of the molecule (sTREM-1) (65-71).
Increased plasma sTREM-1 values, individually considered or in association with other laboratory pa‐
rameters, have been described in patients with bacterial infections and sepsis. Additionally, elevated
broncho-alveolar lavage fluid sTREM-1 concentrations were found in patients with bacterial or fungal
pneumonia and increased pleural fluid sTREM-1 levels in patients with infectious eﬀusions (72-79).
However, increased plasma sTREM-1 concentrations were also observed in patients with acute pancre‐
atitis and non-infectious inflammations after traumatic lung contusion or pulmonary aspiration syn‐
dromes (80-82). In addition, the diagnostic and prognostic performances of sTREM-1 in sepsis and
septic shock was reported to be variable, controversial, and even contradictory according to other clini‐
cal studies that reaﬃrmed the central role of traditional laboratory parameters, such as CRP, IL-6, and
procalcitonin, in distinguishing sepsis from systemic inflammatory response syndrome (65).
In the forensic field, sTREM-1 levels were determined in postmortem serum, pericardial fluid, and
urine in septic and control cases. Increased postmortem serum sTREM-1 levels (cutoﬀ value 90 pg/mL)
were observed in sepsis-related deaths, whereas most control cases had postmortem serum sTREM-1
levels lower than 90 pg/mL. Increased sTREM-1 values were also found in pericardial fluid and urine in
septic cases. However, postmortem serum sTREM-1 levels did not seem to provide improved sensitivi‐

ty and specificity compared to procalcitonin in detecting sepsis after death, indicating that the simulta‐
neous assessment of both biomarkers could eventually help in clarifying specific situations character‐
ized by elusive macroscopic, microscopic, and laboratory findings (9).

Endocan
The vascular endothelium has been demonstrated as playing a critical role in the pathogenesis of sepsis
by producing cytokines and chemotactic factors as well as expressing surface adhesion molecules that
induce circulating leukocyte migration into tissues. Consequently, there is a strong, biological rationale
for targeting markers of endothelial activation as biomarkers of sepsis (83,84).
In clinical practice, a large number of molecules secreted by the endothelial cells have been investigated
as potential biomarkers for the early diagnosis of sepsis. These have included regulators of endothelial
activation, adhesion molecules, as well as mediators of coagulation, permeability, and vasomotor tone
(84).
Endocan (endothelial cell-specific molecule-1) is a soluble 50-kDa proteoglycan made up of a mature
polypeptide of 165 amino acids and a single dermatan sulfate chain covalently linked to the serine
residue at position 137. The molecule is naturally expressed by endothelial cells, is highly regulated in
presence of proinflammatory cytokines and proangiogenic molecules and may be considered an accu‐
rate marker of endothelial activation. Endocan expression was associated with a growing number of
pathological conditions characterized by neoangiogenesis and vascular growth. The molecule was
found freely circulating at low levels in the serum of healthy subjects and overexpressed by several
types of human tumors, particularly highly vascularized cancers (85-97).
Additionally, increased endocan levels were described in patients with sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic
shock compared to healthy individuals, with concentrations related to the severity of the disease. Scher‐
pereel et al (83) proposed a cutoﬀ value of 1.2 ng/mL, which would provide the best sensitivity
(82.50%) and specificity (100%) in identifying septic cases vs SIRS cases. Since endothelial injury is
pivotal in the development of organ failure and shock in sepsis, an endothelial marker such as endocan
might not only reflect the severity of the disease but also represent a promising diagnostic and prognos‐
tic marker of sepsis (8,84,98).
In the forensic setting, endocan levels have been determined in postmortem serum in septic and control
cases. Simultaneous increases in both procalcitonin and endocan levels were identified in septic cases
only. Endocan concentrations were low or undetectable in most control cases, irrespective of the post‐
mortem interval, suggesting that the molecule is not systematically released into the bloodstream after
death following the onset of decompositional changes. Conversely, concentrations over 1.0 ng/mL were
observed only in control cases characterized by diﬀuse vascular injuries, presumably indicating endo‐
can leakage in the bloodstream due to direct endothelial cell damage (99).

Neopterin
Neopterin (D-erytro-1’,2’,3′-trihydroxypropylpterin), a biochemical product of the guanosine triphos‐
phate pathway, was first isolated from human urine in 1965. The discovery of neopterin as a marker of
T-cell activation dates back to the 1980s. The molecule is produced primarily in monocyte/macrophage
and related cells when stimulated by interferon-γ released from activated T cells. Other cell types do
not produce measurable amounts of neopterin following various stimuli. Therefore, the production of
the molecule appears to be closely associated with cellular immune system activation. The biological
function of neopterin is not completely clear. However, it has been demonstrated that neopterin has re‐
lations with nitric oxide synthesis and reactive oxygen metabolites. Based on this, it has been postulated
that the molecule may be toxic for microorganisms and be part of the proinflammatory and cytocidal
armature of activated human macrophages. The upper limit of the reference range is approximately 10
nmol/L ( = 2.5 ng/mL) (8,100-104).
High neopterin concentrations in serum and urine were shown to be a reliable indicator of the severity
of viral (HIV), bacterial, protozoic, parasitic, or fungi-induced infections. Correlations between
neopterin levels and disease states were also found for autoimmune disorders (rheumatoid arthritis, sys‐
temic lupus erythematosus, Crohn’s disease, and autoimmune thyroid diseases). Serum levels of
neopterin were shown to be elevated in subjects with coronary and peripheral artery disease, with con‐
centrations potentially predicting adverse cardiovascular events and heart failure development in pa‐
tients with coronary artery disease, acute coronary syndromes, or severe peripheral artery disease. In
various types of malignant diseases, increased neopterin concentrations were indicated as predictive in
tumor progression, metastasis development and mortality. Although not produced by tumor cells them‐
selves, increased neopterin concentrations most likely reflect the host-defense reaction elicited by the
aggressiveness of the tumor. Furthermore, the monitoring of neopterin concentrations would also allow
early detection of immunological and infectious complications in allograft recipients following kidney,
heart, liver, lung, pancreas, and bone marrow transplants. Since elevated levels are found in infectious
and non-infectious inflammations, the specificity of neopterin as a clinical marker of bacterial sepsis is,
however, limited (101-104).
Forensic use of neopterin was investigated by Ishikawa et al (36) and Ambach et al (105,106). Post‐
mortem serum neopterin levels over 500 nmol/L were observed in bacterial and viral infection-related
cases as well as in delayed deaths due to trauma, thus confirming systemic inflammatory response syn‐
dromes and monocyte/macrophage activation.

Many advances have been made in the identification of novel biomarkers for sepsis diagnosis. However,
substantial discoveries are yet to be made in this field, both in clinical and forensic casework. Although
more than 178 biomarkers have been identified, it remains controversial which of these is the most reli‐
able for the diagnosis of sepsis. None of the currently available markers can be used to undoubtedly
determine whether or not a patient is infected. Similarly, in the forensic field, none of the currently
available biomarkers can be used to establish a definite diagnosis of sepsis-related death. These limits
notwithstanding, at present procalcitonin represents the most reliable parameter for the postmortem di‐
agnosis of sepsis.
Due to the complexity of the sepsis response, several authors have postulated that a combination of bio‐
markers, rather than a single laboratory parameter, might be more eﬀective in order to obtain early and
reliable diagnosis of sepsis in living patients. In our opinion, this same consideration should be applied
to the postmortem field, where the diagnosis of sepsis is even more challenging.
We consider that it is not advisable to reach the diagnosis of sepsis-related death based on laboratory
investigations only, especially when biochemical analyses are limited to a single parameter. Conversely,
in our view, postmortem bacteriology and postmortem biochemistry must always be part of the diag‐
nostic work-up and results must always be interpreted in context, with information from circumstantial
data and medical records (when available), autopsy, histology, and, when feasible, neuropathology and
immunohistochemistry (1-3,8,107,108).

Abstract
Aim
Post‐stroke inflammation increases the risk of functional disability through enlarged cerebral infarct
size directly and follow‐up stroke event indirectly. We aimed to use post‐stroke proinflammatory cy‐
tokine interleukin‐6 (IL‐6) as a marker of inflammatory burden and quantify post‐stroke inflammation's
direct and indirect eﬀect on functional disability.

Methods
We analyzed patients with acute ischemic stroke admitted to 169 hospitals in the Third China National
Stroke Registry. Blood samples were collected within 24 h of admission. Stroke recurrence and func‐
tional outcome measured by the modified Rankin scale (mRS) were assessed via face‐to‐face interviews

at 3 months. Functional disability was defined as an mRS score ≥2. Mediation analyses under the coun‐
terfactual framework were performed to examine the potential causal chain in which stroke recurrence
may mediate the relationship between IL‐6 and functional outcome.

Results
Among the 7053 analyzed patients, the median (interquartile range [IQR]) NIHSS score was 3 (1–5),
and the median (IQR) level of IL‐6 was 2.61 (1.60–4.73) pg/mL. Stroke recurrence was observed in 458
(6.5%) patients, and functional disability was seen in 1708 (24.2%) patients at the 90‐day follow‐up. Per
stand deviation (4.26 pg/mL) increase in the concentration of IL‐6 was associated with an increased
risk of stroke recurrence (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.19; 95% CI, 1.09–1.29) and disability (aOR,
1.22; 95% CI, 1.15–1.30) within 90 days. Mediation analyses revealed that 18.72% (95% CI, 9.26%–
28.18%) of the relationship between IL‐6 and functional disability was mediated by stroke recurrence.

Conclusions
Stroke recurrence mediates less than 20% of the association between IL‐6 and functional outcome at 90
days among patients with acute ischemic stroke. In addition to typical secondary prevention strategies
for preventing stroke recurrence, more attention should be paid to novel anti‐inflammatory therapy to
improve functional outcomes directly.

1. INTRODUCTION
Ischemic stroke, accounting for over 80% of strokes, is the largest contributor to the disease burden of
China's healthcare system. 1 A recent survey in China estimated that ischemic stroke's age‐ and sex‐
standardized prevalence was 2.3% in 2020. 2 With continuous eﬀorts in the medical field and advance‐

ments in clinical practice, the 3 months recurrence of ischemic stroke has declined from 16.6% in
2007–2008 in the China National Stroke Registry (CNSR‐I) to less than 10% in 2015–2018 in the
CNSR‐III. 3 , 4 However, the rate of unfavorable functional outcomes remains as high as approximately
30%. 5
From the biological perspective, inflammation plays a critical role in the pathogenesis and prognosis of
ischemic stroke, both acutely and chronically. 6 , 7 Interleukin‐6 (IL‐6) is a critical post‐stroke proinflam‐
matory cytokine and a marker of inflammatory burden. 8 Previous reports demonstrated that increased
levels of IL‐6 were associated with the larger sizes of the brain lesions, thus resulting in poor functional
outcomes directly. 9 , 10 , 11 On the other hand, IL‐6 may contribute to the pathogenesis and progression
of atherosclerosis, plaque rupture, platelet aggregation, and intravascular thrombosis, which increase
the risk of following stroke events and result in further functional damage. 7 Although prior studies re‐
ported associations between the higher concentration of IL‐6 and higher risks of stroke recurrence or
functional impairment, 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 none of them quantified the extent of functional impair‐
ment resulting from IL‐6 directly or resulting from the pathway of IL‐6–stroke recurrence–functional
impairment.
Using data from the CNSR‐III study, we investigated to what extent, if any, stroke recurrence mediated
the relationships between IL‐6 and functional disability at 90 days among patients with acute ischemic
stroke and assessed the mediation eﬀect in a series of sensitivity analyses.

2. METHODS
The study was approved by the ethics committee of Beijing Tiantan Hospital (KY2015–001‐01). Writ‐
ten informed consent was obtained from each participant or his/her representative before data collec‐
tion. This report follows A Guideline for Reporting Mediation Analyses of Randomized Trials and Ob‐
servational Studies reporting guideline. 19

2.1. Study design and participants
We extracted data from the Third China National Stroke Registry (CNSR‐III), a large‐scale nationwide
prospective registry of acute ischemic cerebrovascular events in China. Details for study design and
patient identification of the CNSR‐III were reported elsewhere. 20 In brief, patients with acute ischemic
stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) occurred within 7 days and aged 18 years old or above were
consecutively enrolled in this registry between August 2015 and March 2018. According to the World
Health Organization criteria, acute ischemic stroke was diagnosed with confirmation by brain magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT). 21

For the current analysis, we included patients from 169 sites participating in the prespecified biomarker
substudy and the imaging substudy. We excluded TIA patients and ischemic stroke patients with prior
functional disabilities, patients who received reperfusion therapy (intravenous thrombolysis or
thrombectomy), and patients with missing data on IL‐6 or 3‐month mRS scores.

2.2. Data collection
Baseline data were collected by trained research coordinators following a standard data collection pro‐
tocol that the steering committee developed. Baseline data include demographics (sex, age, body mass
index); National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS, range 0 to 42, with a higher score indicating
greater stroke severity) score; pre‐stroke modified Rankin Scale (mRS, range 0 [no symptoms] to 6
[death]) score; systolic blood pressure (SBP); diastolic blood pressure (DBP); smoking status; and med‐
ical history, including prior stroke or TIA, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, coronary heart disease
or myocardial infarction(CHD/MI), and atrial fibrillation.
Blood samples within 24 h of admission were collected. Plasma specimens were extracted, aliquoted,
and transported through the cold chain to the central laboratory in Beijing Tiantan Hospital and stored
at −80°C until tests were performed centrally and blindly. The concentration of IL‐6 was measured
without technical repeat by using enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay kits (catalog number: PH‐
S600C, R&D Systems, Inc).
Imaging data were collected in Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) format on
discs and sent to the imaging research center of Beijing Tiantan Hospital. Acute infarction was diag‐
nosed according to hyperintensity on diﬀusion‐weighted imaging and was further classified as single
acute infarction (uninterrupted lesions visible in contiguous territories), multiple acute infarctions
(more than one topographically distinct lesion), or watershed infarction. 22 The etiology of each case
was classified as large‐artery atherosclerosis (LAA), cardioembolism (CE), small‐artery occlusion
(SAO), another determined cause or an undetermined by the classification of the Trial of Org 10,172 in
Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) criteria. 23

2.3. Patient follow‐up and outcomes
Trained research coordinators followed patients in face‐to‐face interviews based on a standardized inter‐
view protocol 90 days after symptom onset. The stroke recurrence was defined as a new neurological
deficit lasting more than 24 h or rehospitalization with a diagnosis of ischemic stroke, intracerebral he‐
morrhage, or subarachnoid hemorrhage. The functional disability was defined as an mRS (range of 0[no
disability] –6 [death]) score ≥ 2, as approximately half of the ischemic strokes were minor strokes in
the CNSR‐III registry.

2.4. Statistical analysis
The study population was categorized according to quantiles of IL‐6 level. Normality for continuous
variables was tested by Shapiro–Wilk tests and checked by Q‐Q plots as well. Baseline characteristics
were described using means and standard deviations or medians and interquartiles for continuous vari‐
ables and frequencies and percentages for categorical variables. Comparisons between groups were
conducted using analysis of variance (ANOVA) or Kruskal–Wallis tests for continuous variables and
chi‐square tests for categorical variables. We used a SAS macro called %ggBaseline to produce the
baseline table automatically. 24 We reported odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs based on logistic regression
models to assess the associations between IL‐6 and stroke recurrence or disability at 90 days. IL‐6 level
was treated as a categorical variable with Q1 as the reference group and then as a continuous variable
with increments of one standard deviation in logistic models.
We used a directed acyclic graph to illustrate the association of IL‐6 with functional disability and fol‐
low‐up stroke recurrence (Figure 1). We performed causal mediation analysis under a counterfactual
framework, in which a clear definition of the mediation eﬀect was provided under a general framework.
25 , 26 , 27
Under this framework, the total eﬀect (TE) was divided into two parts measured as OR: the
natural direct eﬀect (NDE) and the natural indirect eﬀect (NIE). The NDE represented the direct eﬀect
of IL‐6 on functional disability, while the NIE represented the eﬀect of IL‐6 on functional disability via
stroke recurrence. The mediation eﬀect is measured by percentage mediated (PM), computed as
NIE/TE*100% on a log‐transformed OR scale, which is the percentage of the TE that the mediator me‐
diates. 28 We fitted two logistic regression models to calculate the mediation eﬀect. One is the mediator
model, a multivariable logistic regression model for stroke recurrence (mediator) conditional on IL‐6
(exposure) and all study confounders. Another model is the outcome model, a multivariable logistic
regression model for functional disability (outcome) conditional on IL‐6, stroke recurrence, and all
study confounders. Based on the literature review and group discussion, confounders examined in the
causal mediation analysis were determined, which included demographics (age, sex, and body mass
index), NIHSS score at admission, smoking status, SBP, DBP, medical history (prior stroke/TIA, hy‐
pertension, diabetes mellitus, prior CHD/MI, and atrial fibrillation/flutter), image data (infarction pat‐
tern and infarction location) and stroke etiology where appropriate.

All hypothesis tests were 2‐tailed with a type‐1 error rate fixed at 5%. All statistical analyses were per‐
formed using SAS V.9.4 software (SAS Institute Inc.).

2.5. Sensitivity analyses
We performed a series of sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of our analysis. First, to avoid the
competing risk with death, we re‐performed the mediation analysis after excluding patients who died
before stroke recurrence. In addition, to check whether the mediation eﬀect was aﬀected by admission
time, stroke severity, infarction pattern, infarction location, and subtype of ischemic stroke, we per‐
formed causal mediation analysis stratified by onset‐to‐door time (≤6 h, >6 h, or unknown), NIHSS
score (>3, ≤3), infarction pattern, infarction location, and TOAST classification. Furthermore, we re‐
assessed the association of IL‐6 with stroke recurrence and disability and re‐estimated the mediated
eﬀect of stroke recurrence on diﬀerent scales of IL‐6 concentration, including original‐scale, log‐scale,
and per standard deviation (SD) of log‐scale. Considering the impact of infarction volume, we provided
a set of supplemental mediation analyses with the adjustment of infarction volume in the models as
well.

3. RESULTS
We obtained data from 11,384 patients with acute ischemic stroke without baseline disability and with‐
out reperfusion treatment, excluding 3782 patients with TIA, mRS ≥ 2, or receiving reperfusion treat‐
ment from 15,166 admissions. After further exclusion of 4331 patients without blood or imaging sam‐
ples, who had missing data on IL‐6 or lost to follow‐up, we finally included 7053 patients in the current
analysis (Figure S1). Baseline characteristics were largely comparable between patients excluded
and included (Table S1).

Of the 7053 patients analyzed, the age was 62.2 ± 11.3 years; 31.1% (n = 2193) of patients were
women, and the median (IQR) NIHSS score was 3 (1‐5). Hypertension (62.8% [n = 4430]) was the
most common disease history, followed by diabetes (24.5% [n = 1731]) and prior stroke/TIA (22.5% [n
= 1584]). Nearly one‐half of the patients had a single infarction (47.0% [n = 3317]) and 56.9% [n =
4016] of patients had infarcts in the anterior circulation. For etiology classification, one‐quarter of pa‐
tients were LAA (25.7% [n = 1810]), and another quarter was SAO (25.7% [n = 1813]) (Table 1).

3.1. Baseline characteristics
The median (IQR) IL‐6 concentration was 2.61 (1.60–4.73) pg/mL. Figure S2 shows the distribution of
IL‐6. Compared to patients in the lowest quartile of IL‐6, patients in the highest quartiles of IL‐6 were
older (65.9 ± 11.5 vs. 58.5 ± 10.6, p < 0.001), had a severer stroke at admission (median[IQR] of
NIHSS score: 4.0 (2.0–7.0) vs. 3.0 [1.0–5.0]; p < 0.001), and more vascular risk factors, including prior
stroke/TIA (434 [24.6%] vs. 325 [18.4%], p < 0.001), hypertension (1126 [63.8%] vs. 1056 [59.9%], p
= 0.03), diabetes (429 [24.3] vs. 349 [19.8], p < 0.001), dyslipidemia (136 [7.7%] vs. 119 [6.8%], p =
0.008), CHD/MI (226 [12.8%] vs. 116 [6.6%], p < 0.001), and atrial fibrillation (212 [12.0%] vs. 42
[2.4%], p < 0.001). In addition, more multiple infarctions (988 [56.0%] vs. 628 [35.6%], p < 0.001),
simultaneous anterior and posterior circulatory infarctions (160 [9.1%] vs. 69 [3.9%], p < 0.001), and
the LAA subtype of ischemic stroke (560 [31.7%] vs. 311 [17.7%], p < 0.001) were seen in the highest
quartiles of IL‐6 (Table 1).

3.2. Associations of IL‐6 with stroke recurrence or functional disability
During the 90‐day follow‐up, stroke recurrence and functional disability were seen in 458 (6.5%) and
1708 (24.2%) patients, respectively. After adjusting for covariates, patients with the highest quartile of
IL‐6 levels had a non‐significantly 27% higher risk of stroke recurrence (8.8% vs. 5.5%, adjusted OR
[aOR], 1.27; 95% CI, 0.95–1.68) and a significantly 59% higher risk of disability (36.1% vs. 16.3%;
aOR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.32–1.91) at 90 days. We also treated IL‐6 concentration as a continuous variable.
We found that per SD (4.26 pg/mL) increase in IL‐6 concentration was associated with a significantly
19% increased risk of stroke recurrence (aOR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.09–1.29) and a significantly 22% in‐
creased risk of disability (aOR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.15–1.30) at 90 days (Table 2).

Stroke recurrence before disability and disability without stroke recurrence was seen in 16.2% (n = 277)
and 83.8% (n = 1431) of the 1708 functionally disabled patients, respectively. Table 3 shows the total,
direct associations, and indirect associations of IL‐6 with functional disability. The indirect eﬀect of IL‐
6 via follow‐up stroke recurrence implied a 4% increased risk of functional disability (aOR 1.04; 95%
CI, 1.02–1.06) would be observed on average. The mediated proportion of the association between IL‐6
and functional disability by stroke recurrence was 18.72% (95% CI, 9.26%–28.18%) in the adjusted
model. In addition, we excluded patients who died before stroke recurrence to avoid competing risk,
and results showed a comparable mediation eﬀect of stroke recurrence, with a mediated percentage of
23.16% (95% CI, 11.95%–34.37%).

3.4. Sensitivity analyses
Subgroup analysis revealed no heterogeneity in the major subgroup of admission time, NIHSS score at
admission, infarction pattern, infarction location, and etiological subtype (Figure 2). Sensitivity analy‐
ses on diﬀerent scales of IL‐6 concentrations showed similar results with previous analyses that IL‐6
was positively associated with the risk of stroke recurrence and functional disability (Table S2). The
mediation analyses on diﬀerent scales of IL‐6 concentration were also consistent with the primary
analysis (percentage mediated, original‐scale: 17.47% [95% CI, 8.66%–26.28%]; log‐scale: 20.44%
[95% CI, 8.22%–32.66%]; and per SD of log‐scale: 17.60% [95% CI, 6.69%–28.51%]) (Table 4). In ad‐
dition, we additionally adjusted for infarction volume based on the primary mediation analyses, and the
results showed a consistent conclusion (percentage mediated: 19.11% [95% CI, 5.49%–8.35%] for com‐
plete case analysis of infarction volume, 18.77% [95% CI, 8.13%–29.41%] for multiple imputation
analysis of infarction volume) (Table S3).

4. DISCUSSION
In this multicenter cohort study, mediation analyses revealed that less than 20% of the association be‐
tween post‐stroke proinflammatory cytokine IL‐6 and functional disability at 90 days was mediated by
stroke recurrence for patients with acute ischemic stroke, which indicates that more attention should be
paid to the direct eﬀect of post‐stroke inflammation associated functional disability.
Several previous studies have reported associations between IL‐6 and stroke recurrence 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 as
well as associations between IL‐6 and functional disability independent of conventional risk factors
among ischemic stroke patients. 16 , 17 , 18 Results from Mendelian randomization analyses provided evi‐

dence for a causal eﬀect of IL‐6 signaling on ischemic stroke as well. 29 , 30 In concordance with these
previous reports, our study revealed that IL‐6 concentrations were positively associated with stroke re‐
currence and functional disability as well. These data from clinical practices provide a clue for our hy‐
potheses. Our previous report also showed that follow‐up stroke recurrence mediated less than 20% ef‐
fect of another proinflammatory cytokine high‐sensitivity C‐reactive protein on functional disability
from a diﬀerent pathway. 31
In addition, evidence from biological research also provides a solid foundation for our hypothesis. Is‐
chemic events cause neuroinflammation and the release of inflammatory cytokines from immune cells
in brain tissues. IL‐6 is a well‐characterized proinflammatory cytokine that provokes and aggravates an
inflammatory response after stroke. 32 Although the pathophysiology of functional damage after a
stroke is a complex cycle of interconnected molecular and cellular mechanisms, 33 reports indicated that
an increase in the concentration of IL‐6 in serum following a stroke increases injury by contributing to
cell death and blood–brain barrier disruption. 6 , 34 , 35 Other reports also suggested that IL‐6 plays an
important role in cerebral ischemia not only as a mediator of the inflammatory process in the acute
phase of stroke but also has chronic eﬀects that might contribute to the formation and maturation of
atherosclerotic plaques, which increase the risk of stroke recurrence and then resulted in functional
damage as a neurotrophic factor in the late phase of the development of cerebral ischemia. 7 , 33 This
was also consistent with the results revealed from our sensitivity analysis that LAA had a higher per‐
centage of mediation (21%) by stroke recurrence than CE and SAO (13%).
Currently, the typical secondary prevention strategy for stroke is focused on antiplatelet, hypertension,
diabetes, and dyslipidemia, while anti‐inflammation is usually ignored. Our analysis revealed that the
indirect eﬀect of post‐stroke proinflammatory cytokine IL‐6 on functional disability through stroke re‐
currence is less than 20%, which means that over 80% of functional damage results from the pathway of
IL‐6 to functional disability without stroke recurrence. Therefore, anti‐inflammatory therapy and new
therapies targeting poststroke inflammation, that is, cytokine inhibition, should be given more attention.
36 Several previous studies have shown the potential benefits of targeted cytokine antagonist therapies
for atherothrombosis. 37 , 38 A double‐blind, randomized, placebo‐controlled, phase 2 trial also showed
that IL‐6 inhibition with ziltivekimab markedly reduced biomarkers of inflammation and thrombosis
relevant to atherosclerosis in patients with advanced chronic renal disease. 39 Whether the benefits of
ziltivekimab for patients with ischemic stroke exist needs further studies. Other inhibitions, specific
inhibition of the trans‐signaling pathway of IL‐6 using, for example, soluble glycoprotein 130 could be
promising therapeutic tools in future stroke research. 40
This study has several limitations. First, 38.0% (n = 4331) of 11,384 patients were excluded from this
analysis because of no biomarker or imaging samples or missing data on IL‐6 or 90‐day follow‐up
mRS, which may introduce selection bias. However, 95% (n = 4110) of the 4331 patients were excluded
because they enrolled from a site not participating in the biomarker and imaging substudy. In addition,
baseline characteristics between included and excluded patients were largely comparable. Therefore, we

believe that the selection bias would be minimized in this study. Second, patients were recruited up to 7
days after stroke onset, which may introduce heterogeneity because of the admission time. However,
over 50% of the blood sample were collected within 55 h after symptom onset, which would reduce the
heterogeneity. In addition, subgroup analysis by admission time showed similar mediation eﬀects.
Third, during hospitalization, infections may aﬀect the level of IL‐6 and the estimation of the mediation
eﬀect. However, the rate of pulmonary infection was only 4.9% (n = 343), and urinary system infection
was only 1.3% (n = 91) among the included patients. In addition, we could not precisely judge whether
these infections occurred before or after blood samples were taken. Fourth, the concentration of IL‐6
had a skewed distribution, which may aﬀect the estimations of the mediation eﬀect. However, sensitivi‐
ty analyses on diﬀerent scales of IL‐6 revealed stable and reliable results. Fifth, although potential co‐
variates were carefully selected and adjusted for in the models when assessing the mediating eﬀect, oth‐
er unmeasured confounders may still exist. Finally, we exclude patients with prior functional disability
and patients who received reperfusion therapy. Therefore, our conclusions may not be generalized to
these populations.

5. CONCLUSIONS
In this multi‐center cohort study, we found that the association between post‐stroke proinflammatory
cytokine IL‐6 and functional disability at 90 days in patients with ischemic stroke was only partially
mediated by follow‐up stroke recurrence. In addition to the current strategy of secondary stroke preven‐
tion, novel anti‐inflammatory therapy should be given more attention to improve functional outcomes.

Abstract
Gastrointestinal (GI) illnesses are a significant health burden for the US population, with 40 million
oﬃce visits each year for gastrointestinal complaints and nearly 250,000 deaths. Acute and chronic in‐
flammation are a common element of many GI diseases. Inflammatory processes may be initiated by a
chemical injury (acid reflux in the esophagus), an infectious agent (Helicobacter pylori infection in the
stomach), autoimmune processes (graft versus host disease after bone marrow transplantation), or idio‐
pathic (as in the case of inflammatory bowel diseases). Inflammation in these settings can contribute to
acute complaints (pain, bleeding, obstruction, diarrhea) as well as chronic sequelae including strictures
and cancer. Research into the pathophysiology of these conditions has been limited by the availability
of primary human tissues or appropriate animal models that attempt to physiologically model the hu‐
man disease. With the many recent advances in tissue engineering and primary human cell culture sys‐
tems, it is conceivable that these approaches can be adapted to develop novel human ex vivo systems
that incorporate many human cell types to recapitulate in vivo growth and diﬀerentiation in inflammato‐
ry microphysiological environments. Such an advance in technology would improve our understanding

Introduction
Gastrointestinal inflammatory conditions in humans, both acute and chronic, are a significant source for
disease-related morbidity and mortality, both in the U.S. and worldwide. In addition to the human costs
in pain, disability, and premature death, these disorders carry a considerable financial impact as well.
Productivity loses and the enormous expense of medical care strain both familial and societal budgets.
Indeed, the costs for care of U.S. patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a single chronic in‐
flammatory condition, were estimated to be over $6 billion in 2008 (1). Altogether, this severe impact
on patient well-being and the enormous resulting financial burden confirms the importance of research
eﬀorts to better understand and treat these disorders.
Microphysiological culture systems hold great promise to revolutionize research into these important
disease conditions. Although tissue and cell culture methodologies as laboratory techniques have been
established for well over a century, and have significantly contributed to the advancement of biomedical
research and therapeutics, it has become increasingly clear that current standard culture techniques re‐
main highly artificial (2,3). Limitations include an over-reliance on transformed and neoplastic cell
lines, utilization of stiﬀ plastic and glass culture plates, and a dependence upon undefined serums and
matrices to support and sustain cell growth. Microphysiological culture systems, in contrast, seek to
better replicate in vivo microenvironments in an in vitro setting suitable for research laboratories.
Microphysiological culture systems, in contrast, attempt to better model human tissues through a com‐
bination of innovative bioengineered platforms, novel materials, and the use of primary or immortal‐
ized human cells rather than transformed cell lines. This edition of Experimental Biology and Medi‐
cine explores novel bioengineered devices and 3-dimensional culture conditions that are attempting to
replicate every major organ system of the human body. Each utilizes novel approaches to study the biol‐
ogy and physiology of these engineered tissue representations. Moreover, many of these systems are
being explored as platforms for toxicology testing and drug screening, two very powerful applications
of this technology. However, no single platform currently recapitulates all the cell types and biology
inherent in the endogenous tissues. In this review we propose another innovative use of these novel hu‐
man culture systems: to model the eﬀects of acute and chronic inflammatory microenvironments on
human gastrointestinal epithelium. We will explore several inflammatory diseases of the esophagus and

intestine, briefly discuss current cell culture and animal models employed to study them, and propose
how innovative modifications to microphysiological culture conditions can endow them with new func‐
tionalities such as improved modeling of human inflammatory diseases in the laboratory.

Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease and Barrett’s Esophagus
Acute and chronic inflammatory conditions of the esophagus including gastroesophageal reflux disease
(GERD), reflux esophagitis, eosinophilic esophagitis (EOE), Barrett’s esophagus (BE), and esophageal
adenocarcinoma (EAC), cumulatively aﬄict a significant portion of the US population each year (4).
These diseases progress sequentially, with gastric acid and bile refluxed to the esophagus in GERD in‐
flicting tissue injury and inflammation that leads first to esophagitis (Figure 1) (5). An estimated 10–
15% of these patients then proceed to develop BE, a metaplasia characterized by replacement of normal
esophageal stratified squamous epithelium with an intestinal columnar epithelium (Figure 2) (6). These
metaplastic regions then progress to low-grade dysplasia (LGD), followed by high-grade dysplasia
(HGD), culminating in esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). EAC is a deadly cancer with an increasing
incidence rate in the US, and the risk of EAC development for patients with BE is approximately 0.5%
per year (7). Despite its prevalence, its association with EAC, and the increasing incidence of EAC, the
biology of BE and its progression to cancer are poorly understood and are therefore critically important
clinical and basic research imperatives.

plasia and a chronic inflammatory infiltrate are observed.

Development of esophageal inflammatory diseases begins with acid reflux injury followed by the infil‐
tration of immune cells to the site of the injury (Figure 3) (5,8). Secretion of signaling molecules such
as growth factors and cytokines orchestrate the activation of immune cells and direct their diﬀerentia‐
tion. Cytokines bind to naïve CD4+ T cells, upregulating master transcriptional regulators, and induc‐
ing diﬀerentiation into specialized T helper (TH) subsets (TH1, TH2, TH17, or regulatory T cells). Each
of the four lineages then expresses its own distinct set of cytokines and transcription factors, conferring
specific functionality (9). In the esophagus, activation of a TH1 pro-inflammatory response, character‐

ized by production of interferon (IFN)-γ, is typical for acid reflux esophagitis (10). Progression to BE is
accompanied by a shift in cytokine expression patterns, including increased levels of interleukin (IL)-4,
IL-5, IL-10, and IL-13, which are hallmarks of a TH2 humoral immune response (10–12).

Figure 3
Model for progression from GERD to BE to EAC. Illustration summarizing the transition from normal esophageal ep‐
ithelium to metaplastic Barrett’s esophagus (BE) to esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). Following reflux injury, ep‐
ithelial cells experience several genetic events that, when combined with microenvironmental signals from stromal fi‐
broblasts and infiltrating immune cells, trigger the development of intestinal columnar cells in place of stratified epithe‐
lium. BE is a precursor lesion that will continue to accumulate molecular alterations, ultimately leading to the develop‐
ment of dysplasia and invasive EAC.

Several inflammatory mediators have been linked to BE and EAC pathogenesis and disease progres‐
sion. Cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) and its product prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) are highly elevated in BE,
presumably as result of reflux injury, and aid in the recruitment of immune cells including neutrophils,
macrophages, and mast cells (13,14). PGE2 also regulates T cell expansion by activating TH2 eﬀector
cells while suppressing the TH1 response, supporting a cytokine profile shift towards BE.
A number of other molecular events have also been implicated in the development of BE and progres‐
sion to EAC (Table 1). Along the Barrett’s metaplasia to dysplasia sequence (BE → LGD → HGD →
EAC), allelic loss or silencing of the tumor suppressor and cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor
p16 is thought to be one of the earliest occurrences (15). Mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene,
as well as enhanced expression of Bcl2 and cyclin D1 have also been detected in metaplastic/pre-dys‐

plastic BE (16–18). Progression of BE to dysplasia and EAC is frequently accompanied by p21 upregu‐
lation and K-Ras activating mutations (19,20). Altogether, these genes regulate a broad range of cellular
functions from cell adhesion to cell cycle checkpoints and apoptosis, illustrating the complexity of this
esophageal disease and the challenges faced in modeling them in the research laboratory.

novel human cell based organotypic and tissue engineering approaches can be applied to advance our
understanding of BE and EAC pathogenesis.

Modeling Esophageal Diseases
Cell Culture Models: Esophagus
The earliest cell culture models for BE studies used human BE tissue explants and esophageal adeno‐
carcinoma cell lines (21–24). More recently, primary normal human esophageal and Barrett’s epithelial
cell lines were established with retroviral transduction of human telomerase reverse transcriptase
(hTERT) (25,26). Five primary Barrett’s cell lines were developed from various stages of BE progres‐
sion, with CP-A and BAR-T cell lines originating from metaplastic tissue, while CP-B, CP-C, and CPD were all derived from Barrett’s with HGD. While the CP-A, B, C, and D cell lines have documented
chromosomal abnormalities (27), the BAR-T cell line maintains a diploid status, displays normal mor‐
phology, and responds to contact inhibition (28), making them a particularly useful cell line for studies
of disease progression to cancer. Many of the studies using these cell lines in 2-dimensional (2D) cul‐
ture environments have explored the eﬀects of various Barrett’s etiologic agents upon esophageal ker‐
atinocytes, including chronic acid and bile acid treatment (24,29), BMP-4 (30), retinoic acid (31,32),
and the intestine-specific transcription factors Cdx1 and Cdx2 (33–35). While these treatments did
yield increased expression of intestine-specific genes and changes in cell morphology, none succeeded
at inducing a complete BE phenotype in keratinocytes.

Animal Models: Esophagus
Animal models have become the cornerstone for biomedical research, as they allow for the evaluation
of genetic alterations and/or environmental variables in a controlled manner. However, the development
of a murine model that accurately recapitulates human BE continues to be a challenge. Major anatomi‐
cal diﬀerences exist in mice and humans and, as a result, mice do not naturally experience GERD. Oth‐
er anatomic diﬀerences include the absence of submucosal glands, which have been hypothesized as the
cell of origin for BE (36), and the mouse squamous epithelium-lined forestomach. Due to this forestom‐
ach, the transition from squamous to columnar epithelial cells in rodents occurs in the stomach as op‐
posed to the gastroesophageal junction where the squamo-columnar junction occurs in humans. Since
rodents do not typically have GERD, surgical manipulation is necessary to introduce bile and gastric
acid to the esophagus in order to mimic GERD and elicit an inflammatory response that progresses to
metaplasia, dysplasia, and adenocarcinoma (37). Such procedures are technically challenging to per‐
form and do not guarantee production of the desired phenotype. The utilization of transgenic mice has
therefore been adopted as an alternative approach.

To study BE pathogenesis, our laboratory previously generated a transgenic mouse in which an intes‐
tine-specific transcription factor, Cdx2, was ectopically expressed in the mouse esophagus using a Ker‐
atin-14 promoter (38). Cdx2 is required for intestine-specific gene expression, columnar cell shape and
cell-cell adhesion, and is absolutely required for the normal diﬀerentiation of the intestinal epithelium
(39–47). In human BE tissues, CDX2 mRNA and protein are uniformly expressed in biopsy samples
(48, 49). Moreover, Cdx2 expression can be induced in cultures of esophageal keratinocytes treated
with short pulses of acid and bile (24, 29). In addition, ectopic gastric expression of Cdx2 induced a
gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM) similar to human GIM . CDX2 is therefore expected to play a simi‐
lar role in the pathogenesis of BE (33, 50). These K14-Cdx2 mice were found to have significantly re‐
duced esophageal cell proliferation, as well as diminished barrier function. While a complete BE phe‐
notype was not achieved, cells that exhibited ultrastructural features of both squamous and columnar
cells were observed. These hybrid cells indicate that Cdx2 promotes the appearance of a transitional
phenotype that, under a supportive microenvironment, may adopt a metaplastic columnar phenotype.
More recently, a transgenic mouse has been created that over-expresses the cytokine IL-1β in the esoph‐
agus, mimicking chronic esophagitis (51). Expression of IL-1β was specifically targeted to the oral cav‐
ity, esophagus, and squamous forestomach using an Epstein-Barr virus L2 promoter (52). By six
months of age the IL-1β mice displayed moderate inflammation, followed by metaplasia at 12–15
months. Furthermore, the addition of bile acids in their drinking water resulted in significant accelera‐
tion of metaplasia, dysplasia, and cancer in the IL-1β mice but not their wild-type littermates. These
data suggest a synergy between cytokine expression and bile acid exposure in the induction of metapla‐
sia at the squamo-columnar junction. Future studies will explore the role of other genetic factors in dis‐
ease progression using this model, however, inherent diﬀerences between murine and human biology
persists. Perhaps a better way to accurately model the in vivo events occurring throughout the Barrett’s
metaplasia disease sequence will be to use novel human cell-based tissue-engineered culture systems.

Human Engineered Tissue Systems: Esophagus
To be clinically relevant, studies must strive to best mimic human in vivo physiology. However, animal
models have significant limitations as we have seen, and traditional 2D cell culture using human cells
can only represent the eﬀects of a single cell type and fail to capture the significant contributions of the
microenvironment. The development of the organotypic culture (OTC) system that allows for the coculture of immortalized human epithelial cell lines together with primary fibroblasts in 3-dimensional
(3D) tissue reconstructions represents a novel means by which to perform in vitro experiments that are
still physiologically relevant (53). Under 3D OTC conditions, esophageal fibroblasts are embedded in a
collagen matrix, overtop of which, after a period of growth and matrix modification, keratinocytes are
seeded (Figure 4). Exposure of the keratinocytes to the air-liquid interface then triggers diﬀerentiation
and stratification producing a fully mature epithelium (54). This physiologically relevant model thus
provides a novel platform for the study of many human esophageal diseases.

OTC systems to model normal esophageal growth and inflammation. A. Illustration identifying the main components
of the standard OTC method, as well as how to adapt this culture system for the inclusion of immune cells to invoke
inflammation. B. H&E stain of normal human esophageal keratinocytes grown under OTC conditions.

When evaluated under OTC conditions, the Barrett’s cell lines CP-A, CP-B, CP-C, and CP-D show sur‐
prising variability. The HGD-derived CP-B, CP-C, and CP-D lines displayed little to no stromal inva‐
sion, however, the metaplastic CP-A cells not only yielded mucin-producing goblet cells, but also were
unexpectedly highly invasive (55). These major phenotypic diﬀerences were not apparent previously
and were only observed as a result of the more physiological 3D OTC system. This study also under‐
scores the fact that a high level of diversity exists not only between BE patients, but likely within their
own BE segments, as well. As a result, it will be imperative in future studies to include a wide panel of
cell lines and tissues in every stage of disease.
Our laboratory ventured to examine the early genetic and molecular events that precede the develop‐
ment of BE to gain further insight into its pathogenesis. We demonstrated that epithelial expression of
the inflammation-associated enzyme Cox-2 in the hTERT-immortalized human esophageal ker‐
atinocytes produced elevated levels of PGE2 and was suﬃcient to induce a metaplasia with features of
BE (56). In addition, using this same OTC system, we determined through a genetic approach that the
onset of a true BE is a multistep process that requires increased proliferation, senescence inhibition, and
epigenetic alterations (34).
Future innovations will be directed toward increasing the complexity of the OTC cultures by including
other relevant cell types including immune, endothelial, smooth muscle, and neural cells (Figure 4). In
addition, investigators have recently identified conditions by which primary human Barrett’s organoids
can be maintained and expanded in a 3-dimensional culture matrix (57). Together, the novel OTC cul‐
ture system and new primary human Barrett’s cell culture methods will lead to engineered human
esophageal and Barrett’s tissues that better model physiologic responses and therefore, will be far supe‐
rior research platforms than any that are presently available.

GvHD is an unfortunately common complication from allogeneic bone marrow transplantation
(ABMT), the treatment of choice for a number of human malignancies, both hematologic and solid or‐
gan. It is a fatal complication to 15% of ABMT recipients, and can be a rare complication of solid organ
transplantation as well (58, 59). It is caused by the donor cells responding to and attacking the recipient
host alloantigens (60). There are two types of GvHD, acute and chronic, originally defined based on
whether they occurred within 100 days of the transplantation (acute) or after (chronic), but are now rec‐
ognized to have distinctly diﬀerent clinical presentations and underlying molecular pathogenesis.
Acute GvHD occurs in a third to half of all ABMT recipients, and is marked by strong inflammatory
features including dermatitis, cutaneous blisters, crampy abdominal pain with or without diarrhea, nau‐
sea and vomiting, and hepatitis (61). The endoscopic and histologic appearance of small intestine
GvHD can be quite varied, depending upon the disease severity. In very mild disease, the small intes‐
tine mucosa can appear normal, with only focal crypt epithelial apoptosis and mild lymphocytic infil‐
trate characteristic of GVHD visible histologically. Moderately severe disease can present with small
intestinal mucosal edema, increased friability, villus blunting, and small ulcerations (Figure5) (62). The
histology in these cases often demonstrates apoptosis with focal dropout of crypt epithelial cells, small
ulcerations, and lymphocytic infiltrates in the lamina propria are more numerous. In its most severe
form, small intestine GVHD presents with a hemorrhagic epithelium from sloughing of substantial re‐
gions of mucosa and the presence of large ulcers. Histologically there is a dense lymphocytic infiltra‐
tion, epithelial and crypt loss and ulcerations.

crypts, lymphocytic infiltration with small hemorrhage (H), and crypt cell apoptosis.

Molecularly, it is thought to be largely, though not exclusively, a TH1 and TH17 immune response,
whereas chronic GvHD follows more typically a TH2 pathway (60, 63, 64). Treatment of acute GvHD
is directed toward optimizing immunosuppressive therapy, and is typically eﬀective, however about half
of these patients will go on to develop chronic GvHD associated with greater long-term morbidity and
mortality.

2/19/24, 11:12 AM

Chronic GvHD is the more serious and long-term complication of ABMT, occurring in a one to twothirds of ABMT transplant recipients surviving more than 100 days (65). Unlike acute GvHD which is
mediated by alloreactive cytotoxic eﬀects, chronic GvHD is more indolent, resembling autoimmune
vascular diseases (60). Patients can sometimes present with distinctive findings that establish the diag‐
nosis, including sclerosis, esophageal webs, and bronchiolitis obliterans, however more typically they
present with less diagnostic features (65). In these cases the diagnosis is confirmed by a biopsy of in‐
volved tissues which most commonly are the skin, oral cavity, liver, and intestine/gastrointestinal tract
(including esophagus). As in acute GvHD, treatment typically requires immunosuppressive medications
for a median of 2 to 3 years, and in some cases for 7 or more years. The mortality associated with
chronic GvHD, which is as high as 30% to 50% at 5 years, is caused by two mechanisms, organ dys‐
function and failure due to damage by the chronic GvHD, and infectious complications from chronic
immune suppressive medications (60, 65). In summary, the significant morbidity and mortality from
acute and chronic GvHD after ABMT significantly limits the eﬀectiveness of ABMT for hematologic
and solid malignancies and remains an important focus of research.

Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)
Inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are chronic dis‐
orders of the intestine and/or colon, in which patients suﬀer from rectal bleeding, severe diarrhea, ab‐
dominal pain, fever, and weight loss (66–68). In North America, 1.4 million people are aﬀected by IBD
(69). Our current understanding of the pathogenesis of IBD is that they are a result of abnormal host
immune responses brought on by diet and lifestyle in genetically susceptible individuals (70). Host ge‐
netic susceptibility plays an important role in the risk of development of IBD. Several genes have been
identified including those involved in innate immune signaling pathways (ITLN1) (71), autophagy
(IRGM) (72), ER stress responses (ORMDL3) (73), and negative regulators of interferon-gamma (INFγ) signaling (PTPN2) (74). The cornerstone therapies for IBD are immunosuppressive drugs and
steroids, both of which provide variable benefit to the IBD population (75).
Clinical and histopathological observation of tissue from patients with IBD reveals gastric erosions and
ulcerations, the presence of a large inflammatory cell infiltrate concurrent with extensive mucosal and
transmural injury including edema, loss of goblet cells, decreased mucous production and crypt cell
hyperplasia (Figure 6) (66). CD is characterized by an excessive recruitment of leukocytes from the
blood circulation into the inflamed gut wall and massive infiltration of neutrophil granulocytes and
macrophages into the aﬀected mucosa (76–78). During acute flares of CD, neutrophil granulocytes are
found in the stool and have served as a clinical and research tool to quantify levels of disease activity
(76). Although it was previously thought that CD was a TH1-mediated disease while UC was a TH2mediated disease, it has recently been suggested that a TH17 immune response is also involved in the
pathogenesis of IBDs; TH17 cytokines are highly expressed in the intestinal mucosa of both CD and
UC patients (79).

Modeling Intestinal Diseases
Cell Culture Models: Intestine
The intestinal mucosa contains a large variety of cell types in close proximity to the epithelium and the
complexity of this microenvironment is further increased during an inflammatory response with addi‐
tional immune cells infiltrating the lamina propria. Immune and epithelial cells release a variety of sig‐
naling factors and peptides to regulate the inflammatory response (cytokines), recruit phagocytes
(chemokines) and facilitate epithelial repair (growth factors) (75) (Figure 7). To better understand these
key components in IBD, in vitro models have focused on a variety of culture systems utilizing one or
more cell types.

Figure 7
Illustration of key mediators involved in the development of acute intestinal GvHD (aGvHD) and IBD. aGvHD is
caused by donor T cells responding to and attacking recipient host alloantigens with cytotoxic products. Irradiation and
BMT conditioning prior to the BMT injure the intestinal epithelium, leading to intestinal barrier disruption and expo‐
sure of the mucosal immune compartment to bacterial products. These bacterial components are potent activators of an
innate immune response, which trigger a “cytokine storm”, amplifying the immune response and favoring the develop‐
ment of acute GvHD. IBD, such as Crohn’s disease, develops due to the presence of a large inflammatory cell infiltrate
with extensive mucosal and transmural injury including edema, loss of goblet cells, decreased mucous production and
crypt cell hyperplasia. Factors secreted by the intestinal microbiota and immune cells can activate epithelial cells to
produce cytokines that regulate inflammation, chemokines that signal recruitment of phagocytes, and growth factors
with autocrine actions that facilitate epithelial repair and/or damage.

Historically, there have been four diﬀerent cell culture approaches to model and study human small in‐
testine epithelium, 1) primary cell cultures, 2) cell lines established from colon cancers, 3) sponta‐
neously immortalized cell lines from normal intestine, and 4) normal intestinal cell lines immortalized
by oncogenes and other genetic approaches. Each approach has important strengths and weaknesses.
Cell lines established from human colon cancers have been most widely used experimentally. This is
because they are human cells, easy to grow and manipulate in the lab, relatively inexpensive to main‐
tain, and widely available. Several colon cancer cell lines exhibit interesting phenotypes. Three cell
lines Caco-2, HT 29 and T84 express morphological and functional characteristics of diﬀerentiated in‐
testinal epithelial cells including polarized, columnar morphology, vectoral transport, and tight junc‐
tion-dependent barrier (80–83). They can be grown on transwell membranes and other structural sup‐
ports readily, facilitating studies of these properties and functions by cell biologists and physiologists.
Bioengineers fabricating devices to model intestinal epithelium likewise favor them for their ease of use
and functional epithelial barrier.
However, while individual cell lines may be suitable for certain limited purposes (study of tight-junc‐
tion formation and barrier disruption, or transporters and channels, for instance), they fall far short of
physiological models of normal human small intestine. All are colonic in origin, though one cell line,
CaCo-2, express small intestine hydrolases (sucrase-isomaltase, lactase, aminopeptidase N and dipep‐
tidylpeptidase IV) when they spontaneously diﬀerentiate after reaching confluency. Moreover, all of
these cells have considerable gene mutations and epigenetic changes in gene expression, resulting in
many abnormal cellular signaling pathways, stress responses, and cellular metabolism. Perhaps most
importantly, they lack normal intestinal stem cells, and therefore are unsuitable for toxicology studies
exploring the eﬀects of toxins on the vulnerable intestinal stem cell compartment.

Given these disadvantages, investigators have employed other strategies, including isolating from pri‐
mary intestinal epithelial cultures spontaneously immortalized cell lines, or immortalizing primary in‐
testinal epithelial cells using oncogenic proteins like SV40 Large-T antigen, or more recently telom‐
erase. Fetal rat intestinal epithelium yielded a half-dozen spontaneously immortalized cell lines (IEC
and FRIC cell lines), whereas attempts using fetal human intestine yielded a single cell line (HIEC
cells) (84, 85). Another approach was to immortalize cell lines from a primary intestinal epithelial cell
culture using a temperature-sensitive SV40-virus Large-T antigen, an established oncogene, or, more
recently, a combination of non-oncogenic Cdk4 with telomerase (86). In most cases, these cells were
homogeneous, passaged readily in culture, and were typically near-normal genetically. However they
typically exhibited characteristics of poorly diﬀerentiated intestinal epithelium, more like crypt cells
than diﬀerentiated cells in the villi. Moreover, except for human colonic HCEC cells (86), they do not
form a mature polarized epithelial barrier with tight junctions.
In vitro research eﬀorts in IBD have been directed towards understanding the contribution of the ep‐
ithelium in the inflammatory response using single cells treated with specific molecules. Several studies
using colon cancer cell lines observed that common IBD epithelial responses, including injury and re‐
pair, apoptosis, and necrosis, can be induced by microbes or microbial products and immune activation
(75). Another common approach to studying these responses is by co-culturing human colon crypt-like
T84 epithelial cells with bacterial species or bacterial products and/or immune cells (or conditioned
media from such cells). This approach has been particularly eﬀective for studies exploring perturbations
in epithelial permeability (i.e. transepithelial electrical resistance) brought out by inflammatory re‐
sponses (75, 87, 88).
Primary human intestinal epithelial cell cultures in theory should be the most physiologic model, how‐
ever, the isolation of the epithelial cells from the underlying supportive mesenchyme leads to rapid loss
of their diﬀerentiated characteristics, loss of stem cell capacity, and limited viability in culture. In addi‐
tion, the simple culture of cell monolayers in 2D plastic systems does not permit exploration of how
cell-to-cell interactions and a physiologic extracellular matrix can influence mucosal immune cell re‐
sponses. Recent advances in techniques to maintain human small intestinal epithelial cells in long-term
culture employ a 3-dimensional matrix and physiologically relevant growth factors (57, 89, 90). This
innovative culture system is a significant advance, permitting the long-term growth of intestinal stem
cells while permitting normal diﬀerentiation along four intestinal lineages, and the formation of a polar‐
ized epithelium with normal vectoral transport and cell-cell adhesion including tight junctions. This
novel culture system has the potential to significantly advance current GvHD and IBD research prac‐
tices

Mice are far and away the main preclinical animal model for GvHD and studies in mice have made im‐
portant contributions to our understanding of the pathogenesis of this disorder, though other large ani‐
mal models have contributed to our improved understanding as well (60). Mouse models for GvHD in‐
volve transplantation of donor bone marrow along with diﬀerent types of donor lymphocytes into irra‐
diated allogeneic recipients. These recipients typically diﬀer from the donor with regard to their MHC
class I and/or II molecules. The use of these animal models has led to novel insights regarding disease
pathogenesis, including the central role of gastrointestinal injury as an initiating event (91).
Irradiation and other conditioning regimens to prepare the recipient host for the donor BMT also injures
the intestinal epithelium, leading to intestinal barrier disruption and exposure of the mucosal immune
compartment to bacterial products including lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and DNA (91). These bacterial
components are potent activators of an innate immune response, which triggers a “cytokine storm”, am‐
plifying the immune response and favoring the development of acute GvHD (Figure 7). This current
model for acute GvHD is supported by a broad array of observations. Early animal and clinical studies
found that gut decontamination significantly reduced death rates and acute GvHD incidence (91).
Moreover, depletion of T-cells from the graft can abrogate acute GvHD in experimental models (48,69)
(60, 91). Additionally, mutation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), an innate immune receptor for bacterial
LPS, can reduce GvHD risk whereas activation of TLR9 by bacterial DNA can enhance the risk for
GvHD (92, 93). Based on these observations, strategies that manipulate the gut flora, deplete T-cells, or
suppress innate immune responses are an important focus of ongoing research eﬀorts.
The strength of the mouse as a research model for human GvHD lies in our ability to manipulate its
genome and generate transgenic mice with strategic genes “knocked-out” by mutation. The generation
of transgenic mice with inactivating mutations in a host of cytokines and TLRs has enabled our dissec‐
tion of their role in the pathogenesis of this disorder (94, 95). For this reason, mouse models of GvHD
will likely remain an important tool for the foreseeable future. However, these important mouse models
do have significant limitations as well. Fundamentally, while these models can explore the general
pathogenesis of GvHD in the setting of MHC incompatibilities, they cannot test specifically human
MHC alloreactive responses. An equally important consideration is the eﬀect of mouse strain and ge‐
netic drift on GvHD research. It was recently reported that diﬀerences in mouse strains which naturally
occur over time appear to be altering alloreactive immune responses and GvHD severity (96). Finally,
genomic studies of GvHD have identified an increasing number of human polymorphisms that may al‐
ter the risk for the development of GvHD (97), however demonstrating this association beyond observa‐
tional studies in human BMT recipients would require the generation of transgenic mice bearing the
polymorphism, a considerable expense. Together these limitations argue for the development of human
engineered tissues and systems in which acute and, possibly, chronic GvHD can be credibly modeled
using human cells, possibly from BMT patient’s themselves.

A major contribution to our current understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms responsible for the
induction and progression of IBD has been the availability of animal models that recapitulate some as‐
pects of the human disease (66, 98). While not ideal, these rat and mouse models (25–30 models total)
of intestinal inflammation have yielded considerable insights and served as platforms for hypothesis
testing and IBD disease modeling for more than 20 years.
Based on the nature of the inflammation and the method of disease induction, rodent models of intesti‐
nal inflammation are grouped into five major categories: 1) chemically or biologically induced, selflimiting models of colitis (TNBS, DSS, C. rodentium, for example), 2) genetically engineered tradition‐
al transgenic/knock-out/knock-in mice (i.e. IL-7 transgenic, IL-10 knock-out, mutant gp130 knock-in),
3) disruption of T cell homeostasis by adoptive transfer (CD45RB, CD8 transfer models), 4) congenital,
spontaneous mutations (C3H/HeJBir), and 5) spontaneous (cotton-top tamarin) (66, 98, 99). Two of the
more common IBD mouse models currently used in many laboratories around the world are the IL-10deficient (IL-10−/−) mouse model and the T cell transfer model.
Disruption of the IL-10 gene in mice leads to spontaneous pancolitis and cecal inflammation by 2–4
months of age and histopathologically the mouse colon shows many of the same characteristics as those
observed in human IBD (66, 100). The advantage of the IL-10−/− mice is that it is a well-established
TH1-mediated model of transmural colitis. Alternatively, the T cell transfer model utilizes the adaptive
transfer of CD4+CD45RBhigh T cells (naive T cells) from healthy wild-type (WT) mice into syngeneic
recipients that lack T and B cells. Following T cell transfer, pancolitis and small bowel inflammation
develop at 5–8 weeks (66, 101, 102). The major advantage of the T cell transfer model is that it shows
the earliest immunological events associated with induction of gut inflammation and perpetuation of the
IBD. Furthermore, data suggests that transfer of naive T cells into recombinase activating gene-1-defi‐
cient (RAG−/−) mice will provide a model similar to CD development with induction of colitis and
small bowel inflammation (66, 103, 104). Recent evidence also supports that epithelial cell stress and
abnormalities can lead to intestinal inflammation in mice following deletion in XBP1 (105), inositol
requiring enzyme 1β (IRE1β) (106), caspase-8 (107, 108), anterior gradient 2 (AGR2) (109), the RNA
editing enzyme ADAR1(110), or missense mutations in MUC2 (111).
Although these various rodent models lack the complete recapitulation of the clinical and histopatho‐
logical characteristics of human IBD, three underlying principles and recurring themes have evolved.
First, the reason that suggests the T cell-dependent models of IBD are significantly more relevant than
the other models, is that chronic gut inflammation is largely mediated by T lymphocytes. Second, this
inflammation is initiated and perpetuated by commensal enteric bacteria. And third, the genetic back‐
ground of the mouse is an important but poorly understood modulator/modifier of disease onset and
severity (66, 67, 99).

The intestinal and colonic mucosa are both complex and dynamic tissues with epithelial cells arranged
in crypts and villi in the small intestine and crypts in the colon (112–115). In 2011, several groups inde‐
pendently published descriptions of methods by which human intestinal and colonic stem cells can be
maintained and expanded in culture to mimic in vivo microenvironments (57, 89, 116, 117), building
upon an older method of culturing mouse small intestine stem cells (90). In this culture method, human
intestinal and colonic crypts or purified stem cells are embedded in Matrigel (Figure 8). Over several
days they form spherical or elongated oval structures with a crypt-like lumen, referred to as enteros‐
pheres (118). Small intestine and colon spheres can expand into multilobulated enteroids and colonoids
that mimic the ordered structure of the epithelium complete with crypts containing multipotent colum‐
nar base stem cells and Paneth cells. Other intestinal epithelial cell types, including enterocytes, goblet
cells, and enteroendocrine cells (57, 118) can be observed in diﬀerentiated cell regions away from the
stem cell compartment. While the majority of studies conducted with human enteroids and colonoids
thus far have focused on stem cell characterization and regenerative medicine, there is immense poten‐
tial for this culture system in GI research, particularly to model GvHD and IBD. However, they have
not been widely adopted as yet to model these and other human disease conditions.

scopic imaging of a multilobular human intestinal enteroid in culture. C. Alcian Blue staining of a human intestinal
enteroid identifying mucin-producing Goblet cells.

Ideally, it would seem to be then that the next step in the advancement of these micophysiological in‐
testinal culture systems would be the inclusion of additional intestinal cell types such as fibroblasts,
smooth muscle cells, and immune cells to better mimic normal and disease environments. The inclu‐
sion of immune cells is of particular interest to our laboratory as a way to induce inflammatory respons‐
es that model GvHD and IBD diseases (Figure 8). Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells can be
easily and safely isolated from human volunteers and patients; these cells directly, or fractionated sub‐
populations, can be added to the intestinal cultures and treated with cytokines to induce TH1 or TH2
type responses. The eﬀects of these inflammatory responses on intestinal epithelial stem cell viability
and proliferation would be of interest, as would the eﬀects of TReg and other suppressor populations on
the inflammatory response. Furthermore, tissues and immune cells from individuals with specific ge‐
netic polymorphisms could be tested to determine the eﬀect of these polymorphisms on the in vitro in‐

duction of a GvHD or IBD inflammatory response. Interestingly, genetic polymorphisms in E-cadherin
and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 α are thought to contribute to UC risk (119) and would be ideal candi‐
date genes to test in vitro for eﬀects on tissue structure and function in the intestine.
In terms of personalized medical applications, growing intestinal epithelial cells from GvHD or IBD
patients, and combining them with their own isolated immune cells could serve as a novel microphysio‐
logical platform to screen the eﬀectiveness of various therapies for that particular patient. In addition,
the inclusion of other microphysiological systems representing the liver, kidneys, and other organ sys‐
tems onto the platform would also serve to identify potential unexpected toxic and idiosyncratic re‐
sponses thereby maximizing therapeutic eﬃcacy and minimizing unwanted side-eﬀects associated with
treatment and therapy. One could, for instance, examine the role for the cytotoxic cytokine IL-13 in UC
pathogenesis, in particular its eﬀect on epithelial apoptosis. Moreover, one could potentially screen for
agents to suppress this IL-13 cytotoxicity in patient-derived organoid systems as a novel approach to
drug discovery (120).

Future directions: integrating complex biological systems into innovative platforms
The OTC and enteroid culture systems discussed here for modeling gastrointestinal inflammatory con‐
ditions have several distinct advantages. First and foremost, they utilize normal, non-transformed hu‐
man cells grown under physiological conditions. Second, these innovative culture environments allow
for the maintenance of a stem cell population, which until recently was not possible for intestinal ep‐
ithelial cell cultures (57, 89, 90). Third, and of equal importance, the culture conditions are permissive
for full cellular and morphologic diﬀerentiation, including the formation of the multilayered squamous
epithelium of the esophagus, or the development of crypt structures and multilineage daughter cells
(enterocytes, enteroendocrine, Paneth, and goblet). Lastly, these culture systems can be easily modified
to include other cell types of interest, such as fibroblasts, immune cells, and smooth muscle cells, for
example. Therefore the complexities of the actual human tissue can be more completely modeled.
However, these novel culture systems do have two important limitations which will restrict their appli‐
cation to research labs. The complex conditions that yield these biologically relevant models are not
easily adapted to a clinical lab for diagnostic purposes. Nor are they suitable for high-throughput ap‐
proaches favored by industry and the FDA for screening of novel compounds for therapeutic or toxic
eﬀects. Moreover, while it is possible to study vectoral nutrient transport, channel and transporter activ‐
ity, and epithelial barrier function in the enteroids (121, 122), it is more diﬃcult than when cells are
cultured on Transwell or similar platforms.
Innovative bioengineered platforms are under development that, if modified, may resolve these limita‐
tions. The eﬀort to microfabricate human organs on small culture devices has yielded a number of suc‐
cessful designs(123–127). These devices can mimic peristalsis, incorporate a microbiome, and absorb
and metabolize drugs in a physiologically relevant manner. However, all these devices were tested using

human colon cancer CaCo-2 cells because of their ease of culture and their ability to diﬀerentiate into
polarized, columnar epithelial cells with functional tight junctions. Modifications to these platforms,
such that they can support intestinal enteroid growth, including the maintenance of a crypt compart‐
ment with viable stem cells, would yield a device with relevant biology and excellent functionality.
In conclusion, novel engineered human gastrointestinal tissue systems that recapitulate normal physiol‐
ogy provide an innovative and attractive approach to model inflammatory diseases of the gastrointesti‐
nal track including GvHD and IBD. Adapting these research platforms to the new proposed uses has the
potential to yield new insights into human disease pathogenesis. It will also likely advance the develop‐
ment of novel therapeutics and provide tools to better personalize medical therapies.

cell stabilizers and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used to treat inflammatory
diseases/disorders of the eye. There have been several attempts via different approaches of drug delivery to
overcome the low ocular bioavailability resulting from shorter ocular residence time. The features like
safety, ease of elimination and ability to sustain drug release have led to application of biopolymers in
ocular therapeutics. Numerous polymers of natural origin such as gelatin, collagen, chitosan, albumin,
hyaluronic acid, alginates etc. have been successfully employed for preparation of different ocular dosage
forms. Chitosan is the most explored biopolymer amongst natural biopolymers because of its inherent
characteristics. The emergence of synthetic biopolymers (like PVP, PACA, PCL, POE, polyanhydrides, PLA, PGA
and PLGA) has also added new dimensions to the drug delivery strategies meant for treatment of
ophthalmic inflammations. The current review is an endeavor to describe the utility of a variety of
biomaterials/polymers based drug delivery systems as carrier for anti-inflammatory drugs in ophthalmic
therapeutics.

1. Introduction
The occurrences of inflammation have been well recognized and documented since the ancient times.
Celsius explained the four striking symptoms of inflammation (rubor, calor, dolor, and tumor, or redness,
heat, pain, and swelling) in 30 CE [1]. Functio laesa (dysfunction of the organs participating) added as 5th
feature of inflammation in the work of Rudolf Virchow in the 1850s [2]. Inflammation encompasses host of
pathophysiological events and varies individually such as acute or chronic, reversible or irreversible, organ
specific or generalized however, one fact is correct above all that this is taking place via the agency of
several mediators ranging from amines (histamine,5-HT), peptides (bradykinin,interleukin-1 IL-1) lipids
(prostaglandins PGs, leukotrienes LTs)enzymes, complements and many more. The results from competitive
antagonists acting on same receptors and inhibitor of synthesis studies confirm their role in inflammation
[1], [2], [3]. In the late 19th century, Elie Metchnikoff brought the notion of phagocytosis, a basic component
of innate immunity, subsequent to observing protozoa ingest particulate matter and testing blood
leukocytes engulf foreign bodies. Inflammation play an important role in host defenses against infectious
agents and injury, however it also leads to the pathophysiology of several chronic diseases like diabetes,
cardiovascular disease, some cancers and bowel diseases, arthritis and osteoporosis [2].
Inflammation of the eye is a common clinical problem that may involve any part of the eye. Prostaglandins

(PGs) are regarded as mediators of the inflammatory process in many organs, including the eye. High levels
of PGs have been demonstrated in aqueous humor of human and laboratory animals in some forms of
ocular inflammation [4]. Role of cytokines [IL-l, IL-6, IL-S, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), granulocyte
macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF)] in ocular inflammation has been demonstrated in
experimental animals [5]. Further, neurokinins (SP, NKA and NKB) are also involved in the modulation of the
local ocular inflammation initiated by the surgical perforating trauma of the anterior pole. By increasing the
vascular permeability SP, NKA and NKB make an important linkage by which the nervous system mediators
contribute to the modulation of eye inflammatory responses whose intimate mechanisms are not entirely
known yet [6].

2. Ocular inflammations
There are various ocular inflammatory eye diseases such as blepharitis, conjunctivitis, keratitis, scleritis and
uveitis embracing iritis, iridocyclitis, choroiditis, chorioretinitis, retinitis etc., which upon worsening may
impair normal functioning of the eye [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17].

3. Treatment of ocular inflammations and drug delivery
There are four major categories of anti-inflammatory drugs used to provide therapeutic as well as
prophylactic effects in eye inflammatory diseases viz. - corticosteroids, antihistamines, mast cell stabilizers
and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). There should be selection of an appropriate drug class
based on pathophysiology of the eye condition. The physician must be very careful while primary care of
ocular inflammatory conditions. Mast cell stabilizer should be prescribed only for prophylaxis.
Antihistaminic drops may be prescribed for acute symptomatic relief. Topical steroids should be prescribed
after consultation with ophthalmologist [18].
At present, topical delivery via eye drops makes approximately 90% of all ophthalmic products.
Nevertheless, this delivery route is very inappropriate and in few cases contributes to grave side effects.
Topical delivery of ophthalmic drops leads to altering extent of drug delivery to the ocular tissues and
therefore, restrains their therapeutic effectiveness [19], [20], [21], [22]. An eye-drop, notwithstanding of the
introduced bulk, is frequently cleared swiftly in 5–6 min following application, and merely a minor volume
(1–3%) of an eye-drop essentially extents the intraocular tissue. There have been attempted a number of
dosage forms like viscous solutions, suspensions, emulsions, ointments, aqueous gels, and polymeric inserts
etc., in order to enhance ophthalmic bioavailability and to prolong the retention over the surface of the eye.
Biodegradable polymers (natural as well as synthetic) provide several merits as compared to nonbiodegradable polymers for controlled drug delivery. They do not require surgical removal after application,
considered as the most obvious advantage in ocular drug delivery since it can contravene surgical intricacies
linked with non-biodegradable implanted devices. These biodegradable polymers have many beneficial
features like biocompatibility with tissues of the eye, biodegradability and mechanical strength. They offer
least toxicity and besides their decomposition, substances are innocuous with respect to local and systemic

reaction. Due to the adequate mechanical characteristics, they may be designed to offer wide range of
properties.

4. Biodegradation mechanisms and biomaterials in ocular drug delivery
Biodegradation may be defined as an enzymatic or non-enzymatic hydrolysis of the polymeric structure
into water soluble or insoluble substances. Biodegradation contain two parallel methods, degradation and
erosion. In the degradation step, schism of the polymeric foundation into low molecular weight fragments
takes place, while the erosion mechanism deals with the physical event such as dissolution and diffusion of
low molecular weight portions from the polymer matrix. The degradation outputs are eventually cleared
from the body through routine metabolic passage [23]. Heller has explained 3 core mechanisms of polymer
degradation and categorized the polymers on the basis of the degradation mechanisms [24]. Schematic
portrayals of polymer degradation mechanisms are shown in Fig. 1.

hydrolysis, ionization or protonation. Type I explains the degradation of water-soluble macromolecules.
Type II discusses the dissolution of water insoluble macromolecules. Type III entails the degradation of
insoluble polymers with labile bonds.
Source: Biomaterials, reproduced with permission from Biological Engineering Society.
Mechanism I elaborate the degradation of water-soluble macromolecules that are entangled to make 3-D
structure. The network is sturdy and is insoluble unless crosslinks remain intact. Degradation in such
systems may either happen at crosslinks (type IA) or at the principal chain (type IB). Usually, degradation of
type IA polymers yields high molecular weight, water-soluble fractions, whereas degradation of type IB
polymers results in low molecular weight, water-soluble oligomers and monomers.
Mechanism II explains the dissolution of water-insoluble macromolecules having side groups that are
transformed to water-soluble polymers because of ionization, protonation or hydrolysis of the groups. By
this mechanism, the polymer does not decompose and its molecular weight keeps in fact unaltered.
Materials showing type II erosion are cellulose acetate derivatives and fractionally esterified copolymers of
maleic anhydride. These polymers turn soluble by ionization of carboxylic group as exhibited by type II
erosion.
Mechanism III discusses the degradation of insoluble polymers with labile bonds. Hydrolysis of labile bonds
leads to cleavage of the polymer structure, thus producing low molecular weight, water-soluble molecules.
Polymers experiencing type III erosion are poly(lactic acid), poly(glycolic acid) and their copolymers,
poly(orthoesters), polyamides, poly(alkyl-2-cyanoacrylates) and polyanhydrides. The 3 mechanisms
explained are not relatively exclusive; combinations of them may take place.
The intricate anatomy of the eye poses obstacles for the access of drugs as well as their carriers. In general,
the ocular bioavailability of active pharmaceutical substances upon topical application is below 5%. This
may be attributed to spillage due to blinking, shorter stay period in cul-de-sac and nasolacrimal elimination.
Moreover, lipophilic characteristic of epithelium of cornea and hydrophilic nature of adjacent stroma also
present hurdles in transit of hydrophilic and lipophilic drug molecules, respectively. Besides, the
occurrences of various efflux pumps like P-glycoprotein, multi-drug resistance related proteins and breast
cancer resistant protein on variety of ocular tissues limit the access of the drug molecules inside the eye
[25]. Numerous attempts have been made in order to achieve a successful ocular drug delivery.
Biodegradable polymers of natural origin such as gelatin, albumin, chitosan, hyaluronic acid and synthetic
biodegradable polymers like PVP, PACA, PCL, PEO, polyanhydrides and thermoplastic aliphatic polyesters
such as PLA, PGA and PLGA have been entirely exploited for ophthalmic delivery systems [26]. FDA has also
permitted these polymers for human uses. The polymers (natural and synthetic) are discussed in detail
encompassing formulations aspects, evaluation and significant findings from different ocular dosage forms
in forthcoming sections, which are employed as carriers for anti-inflammatory agents. A summary of such
biopolymers is provided in Table 1 and Table 2.

5. Natural biodegradable polymers
5.1. Gelatin
Gelatin is a polymer from natural origin, procured from the crude protein collagen through chemical
processing. Owing to its biocompatibility and biodegradability gelatin is commonly employed in
pharmaceutical and medical uses. In market gelatin is supplied in two types like type A and type B. Type A
gelatin is the acid treated collagen, while type B gelatin comes from alkaline processed collagen. These
chemically treated gelatins possess changing isoelectric points, 7–9 for type A and 4–5 for type B. Ocular
delivery systems of gelatin may be honed by changing the electrical and physical features of gelatin [27].
Vandervoort and Ludwig formulated gelatin nanoparticles entrapping pilocarpine HCl and hydrocortisone
for topical ocular uses. They summarized that gelatin could be a potential polymeric carrier because of
sustained stay period at surface of the eye [28]. Attia et al. prepared a cross-linked gelatin insert to enhance
bioavailability of dexamethasone in the rabbit eye. The dexamethasone concentrations in the aqueous

humor were recorded as 4 fold higher compared to a dexamethasone suspension [29]. Mathurm and
Gilhotra formulated soluble ocular inserts of aceclofenac by solvent casting method in order to improve its
bioavailability in the eye. They observed that cross-linked formulation (AF 8) sustained the drug release up
to 24 h. The formulation was found to be nonirritant and well tolerated upon ocular irritation check by hen's
egg chorioallantoic membrane test (HET-CAM). Further, in vivo studies demonstrated a higher inhibitory
effect of aceclofenac inserts over the eye drops formulation against PGE2-induced ocular inflammation as
the values of lid closure score (0 v/s 0.200 ± 0.447 after 8 h) and PMN count (Fig. 2) was less in case of
formulation versus eye drops [30].

Potu et al. prepared and characterized ocular films of Ketorolac tromethamine. The thickness of films were
in the range of 0.19 ± 0.01 µm to 0.29 ± 0.01 µm with drug content of 93.49 ± 0.05%–99.00 ± 0.05%. The films
did not cause any irritation upon application in cul de sac of rabbit eye [31]. Tseng et al. formulated cationic
gelatin nanoparticles, which were evaluated for in vitro biocompatibility using human corneal epithelium
(HCE) cells, and in vivo safety by administering them as eye drops to New Zealand rabbits. The nanoparticles
were found to be non-toxic to HCE cells. Further, the nanoparticles having positive charge were retained for
prolonged periods in the corneal tissue. This was attributed to the fact that the cornea and conjunctiva
possess negative surface charges [32].

eye like the sclera, stroma and cornea. Various types of collagens are traced in human body, which are
usually 300 nm in length of molecular weight about 300,000. Collagen type I is the usual and completely
used protein of mammals [33]. Collagen generated from the animal sources like porcine and bovine could be
exploited for human uses, due to secondary and tertiary structural resemblance with the human collagen.
One of the most commonly investigated drug carrier uses of collagen are inserts and shields for drug
delivery to the surface of the cornea or to the cornea alone and intraocular drug delivery. Hwang et al.
developed collagen corneal shields containing dexamethasone for improvement in its penetration into
corneal tissue. The collagen shields presoaked with dexamethasone yielded higher drug concentration
against conventional eye drops. Thus, it was concluded that shields offered improved penetration and
improved patient compliance too by reducing the application frequency of concerned drug [34]. Milani et al.
investigated the application of collagen shields soaked with an antibiotic-corticosteroid (gentamicin5 mg + dexamethasone-3 mg) mix to deliver both drugs to rabbit eyes [35]. The release of dexamethasone
was observed in sustained fashion. The findings from in vitro drug release was corroborated by in vivo
studies as the concentration of dexamethasone in aqueous humor was less (P = 0.004) after 1 h of
application but significantly higher(P = 0.028) after 6 h time point in comparison with subconjunctival
injection (Fig. 3). Similar results were observed using flurbiprofen and other drugs in combination with
collagen shields by Aquavella et al. [36]. A European patent has described a collagen containing gel as a
carrier for ketorolac tromethamine for ocular application. The formulation is flowable liquid at ambience
temperature and forms a gelled sustained release matrix after administration to the mammalian eye [37].
The favorable characteristics of collagen such as excellent biocompatibility, absorption capacity and low
immunogenicity have facilitated its corneal applications [38], [39].

5.3. Chitosan
Chitosan (CS) is a polymer from nature procured from chitin that on deacetylation yields chitosan. Chitin
makes exoskeleton of arthropod and mainly made up of D-glucosamine linked via 1–4 linkage [40]. Chitosan
has different physical features like mucoadhesiveness and penetration improving habit, which endorse its
potential for ocular drug delivery. Its mucoadhesive characteristic is due to the positive charge of amino
groups, which interacts with the negatively charged ocular tissues like the cornea and sclera. Its
mucoadhesive trait is favorable for enhancing the ocular bioavailability [41]. CS enhances the permeability
of drug moiety by altering the tight junctions of the corneal epithelial cells in a reversible fashion. Findings
propose that CS modifies the paracellular and transcellular passages sans disturbing the cellular make up
[42], [43]. The history of its use in ophthalmology started with its employment as a viscosity and
permeation agent, evolving to its use as the main constituent of different nanometric delivery systems. De
Campos et al. made an effort to decipher the mechanism of fluorescent-labeled chitosan nanoparticles
interaction with corneal cells upon instillation into rabbit eyes. The findings of the study revealed close
interaction of chitosan nanoparticles with corneal and conjunctival epithelia yielding a higher retention as
compared to chitosan solution. Further, these nanoparticles were found to have penetrated across corneal
epithelium [41]. De Salamanca et al. achieved similar results while studying in vitro and in vivo behavior of
chitosan nanoparticles with epithelial cells on the surface of the eye. In addition, the chitosan nanoparticles
were better tolerated as evident through absence of any signs of ocular inflammation on rabbit eyes. The
nanoparticles were internalized into Human conjunctival epithelial cells (IOBA-NHC) showing presence of
fluorescein isothiocyanate-bovine serum albumin (FITC-BSA) fluorescent signal (Fig. 4). This was concluded
from the study that chitosan nanoparticles might serve as promising carriers for drug molecules for ocular
delivery [44]. Badawi et al. developed nanoparticles as well as nanoemulsions based on chitosan in order to
improve bioavailability of indomethacin and prolong its precorneal residence time. The both nanocarriers
were formulated by methods described previously by Calvo et al. The mean size of nanoparticles was
280 ± 6.4 nm. The entrapment efficiency of indomethacin was also good (84.8 ± 0.81%). The globule size of
nanoemulsion was in the range of 220–690 nm varied with type of surfactant used. The results from in vivo
studies indicate clear healing of chemical induced ulcers in rabbit eyes. The AUC for nanoemulsion was 17fold higher than drug solution in aqueous humor. It was concluded that it was not due to additive chitosan
mechanisms of mucoadhesion and the influence on the tight junctions but the non-ionic surfactant
poloxamer F 68 as a component also could be responsible for the enhanced penetration and the noted
modified healing rate [42], [45], [46]. Asik et al. prepared and characterized ketorolac tromethamine
(ketorolac) loaded chitosan nanoparticles for treatment of different ocular diseases such as pseudophakic
cystoid macular edema, allergic conjunctivitis and diabetic macular edema. Chitosan nanoparticles were
prepared by using co-precipitation technique. The average size of the spherical nanoparticles was in the

range of 180–200 nm. The drug loading was up to 41% (maximum for drug concentration 3.2 mg). The drug
release profile exhibited primarily burst release succeeded by sustained drug release until 72 h. Based on
these in vitro studies they suggested that chitosan nanoparticles are promising drug carriers in treatment of
ocular diseases [47]. Ibrahim et al. developed bioadhesive cationic chitosan nanoparticles containing
celecoxib. The preparations were evaluated for size, surface morphology and drug content. Moreover, these
nanoparticles were incorporated to topical ocular dosage forms such as eye drops, temperature-stimulated
in situ gelling system and preformed gel. Findings of the ultimate formulations celecoxib-loaded chitosan
nanoparticles are: particle size of 113.33 ± 4.08 nm; zeta potential of + 36.92 ± 3.38 mV and incorporation
efficiencies of 89.88 ± 4.17%. Transmission electron microscopic studies showed that all nanoparticles have
unique spherical shapes having a solid dense core coated with uniformly distributed covering. In vitro
release data of ocular preparations exhibited a prolonged release sans any burst effect and the formulations
obeyed a Higuchi non-Fickian diffusion mechanism. The outcome of in vitro cell toxicity showed that all the
preparations are non-toxic, since the % cell viability ranged from 89.9 to 97.7%. This could therefore, work as
a promising drug delivery system for anterior as well as posterior eye diseases [48]. Calvo et al. formulated
chitosan-coated and poly-L-lysine-coated poly-ε-caprolactone nanocapsules containing indomethacin. The
average size of chitosan-coated nanocapsules was 384 ± 60 nm with zeta potential of + 37.1 ± l.8 and
incorporation efficiency was 91.8 ± 8.9%. The drug release was independent of polymers coatings as about
85% of drug released in 2 h. Findings report that, at 30 and 60 min after application, the amount of
indomethacin in the cornea was about 4–6 fold greater for the nanocapsules versus indomethacin eye
drops. Same outcome were achieved upon determination of the aqueous humor. It was seen that that the
CS-coated nanocapsules enhanced the indomethacin content in the cornea as well as aqueous humor to
more extent than other colloidal systems. The improved uptake of the CS-coated nanocapsules can be
assigned to distinct character of CS not the positive charge. Moreover chitosan did not contribute significant
disturbance in the epithelial cells therefore could safely be employed for ophthalmic delivery [49]. Similarly
De Campos et al. compared the efficiency of polyethylene glycol and chitosan with reference to interaction
with rabbit cornea by coating poly-ε-caprolactone nanocapsules. Results suggested that chitosan could be a
better alternate to other available coating materials [50]. Qu et al. formulated Quaternary ammonium
palmitoyl glycol chitosan aggregates containing prednisolone. The loading of prednisolone to polymer
formulation A7 (Mol. wt. − 19.9 kDa) resulted in drug polymer clusters of particles size in the range of 10–
100 nm. These carbohydrate nanoparticles ease drug absorption from the cornea to the aqueous humor
albeit not successful to carry drug to the back of the eye. Nevertheless, this is normal with respect to the
topical route of delivery and properties of the drug [51]. Diebold et al. formulated liposome-chitosan
nanoparticle complexes and evaluated their promise to carry drugs to the ocular surface. The complex has
exhibited retention in mucus cells and penetration into conjunctival cells to varying extent. Further, the
system has shown minimum toxicity and nice tolerance upon in vitro- in vivo studies. These findings
(similar to De Salamanca et al.) indicate the complex to be utilized as drug carrier in the future [44], [52]. Li
et al. formulated liposomes containing diclofenac sodium coated with low molecular weight chitosan. First,
chitosan after treatment was converted to varying molecular weight chitosan fractions. To this, the
liposomes prepared by injection method were added slowly under magnetic agitation. The entrapment

efficiency up to maximum values of 100% were observed. The coating with chitosan has changed the surface
characteristics of the liposomes as zeta potential value of + 10.1 mV was observed against − 26.1 mV for
uncoated liposomes. Apparently, coatings had no impact on entrapment efficiency and drug release from
the vesicles. The pre-corneal retention was significantly higher in case of coated liposomes versus uncoated
ones owing to positive charge and inherent bioadhesive features of chitosan. Similarly, corneal penetration
was found to be better in coated liposomes with keeping corneal cells intact. Hence, they proposed the
coated liposomes as novel drug delivery system to the eye [53]. Tsukamoto et al. prepared and optimized
bromfenac-loaded liposomes having surface coatings of chitosan by acetate salt pH gradient method. The
particle size of almost all vesicles was under 100 nm. The liposomes were found to achieve 100% drug
entrapment. The concentration of chitosan (0.15%) used for surface alterations was selected based on its
property to offer mucoadhesion without triggering aggregation. The drug release was observed for
prolonged periods in case of coated liposomes versus drug solution. The inferences indicated that such
system might be able to deliver drug to the posterior segment of the eye [54]. Luo et al. formulated NLC
(nanostructured lipid carrier) containing flurbiprofen by melt-ultrasonic method and afterwards coated
with COS (Chitosan Oligosaccharides) having molecular weight of 3000–6000 kDa. The prepared
formulations were spherical in shape and bilayered in case of COS coatings. The coating with COS caused a
slight increase in size of vesicles 77.9 nm (0.5% COS coating) against average size of 55.4 nm in case of
uncoated liposomes. The corneal permeation was found to be higher in COS coated NLCs as compared to
uncoated NLCs and flurbiprofen eye drops (0.03%). The lipids confers the compatibility with corneal surface
whereas COS offers bioadhesion as well as improvement in penetration. Results from gamma scintigraphy
also confirm prolonged retention of COS coated NLCs. Further, the histopathology of corneal tissue, which
have undergone treatment with combination of COS-NLCs revealed no damage thus heralding tolerance and
safety of applied formulations [55].

5.4. Albumin
Albumin is a protein that can be obtained from a variety of sources, including egg white (ovalbumin), bovine
serum albumin (BSA), and human serum albumin (HSA). Albumin is a major soluble protein of the
circulating system and involved in the maintenance of osmotic pressure and binding and transport of
nutrients to the cells. Many drugs and endogenous molecules are known to bind to albumin. Albumin serves
as a depot and transporter protein [56]. The high solubility of albumin (up to 40% w/v) at pH 7.4 makes it an
attractive macromolecular carrier capable of accommodating a wide variety of drugs. It possesses stability
in the pH range of 4 to 9 and may withstand 60 °C up to 10 h sans any ill consequence [57]. Albumin is
widely used in the preparation of nanospheres and nanocapsules [58]. These albumin nanocarriers are
biodegradable, easy to prepare, and have well-defined sizes and reactive functional groups (thiol, amino,
and carboxyl) on their surface that can be used for ligand binding and other surface modifications. The
biodegradation of albumin in vivo is a factor of the enzymatic activity. In vivo human serum albumin
nanoparticles and microparticles of an average size of 1.5 µm and a maximum size of approximately 5 µm
decompose from their centre subsequent to phagocytes by human macrophages [59]. Zimmer et al.
formulated albumin nanoparticles containing hydrocortisone by modified desolvation process using
glutaraldehyde as cross-linker. The nanoparticles so formed were 100 to 300 nm in size. The strength of
hydrocortisone solution was kept 0.03% corresponding to its aqueous solubility (i.e. − 0.00298 mg/ml). The
incorporation efficiency of hydrocortisone was found to be in the range of 42–52%. The trans-corneal flux
values were significantly reduced when compared to hydrocortisone reference solution (reference solution 4.65 µg cm− 2 h− 1 versus formulation-2.52 µg cm− 2 h− 1). After inflammation, drug delivery to the eye
compartments was relatively greater with the nanoparticles preparation than with the solution. This
suggested that the inflammatory processes seem to lead largely of nanoparticles mediated hydrocortisone
tissue adhesion or even tissue uptake than after administration of a reference solution. As a result, in the
inflamed eye, nanoparticles facilitated hydrocortisone targeting to the precorneal area beyond the internal
segments of the eye [60]. Zhang et al. strived to address postcataract endophthalmitis by preparation of
bovine serum albumin-meloxicam nanoaggregates employing acid-base neutralization reactions. The
nanoaggregates were further processed with HEMA in order to give gel preparation. The mean particle size
of such nanoaggregates was recorded to be 99.48 ± 0.53 nm. There was observed a decrease in corneal
permeation of meloxicam nanoaggregates gel as compared to meloxicam solution in gel (solutionJss = 0.056 µg cm− 2 s− 1 versus nanoaggregates-Jss = 0.038 µg cm− 2 s− 1). The gel formulations were well
tolerated by the rabbit eyes as evaluated by Draize test whereas the meloxicam solution was found to cause
mild redness in iris upon frequent instillations. The BSA coating was found to non-irritant to rabbit eyes on
histopatological investigations. Therefore, the researchers suggested introducing this technique for the cure
of postcataract endophthalmitis treatment with other medical devices and as carrier for low molecular

2/19/24, 11:24 AM

weight drugs. The BSA coatings conferred the formulation capability to retard the drug release (about 80%
drug release after 12 h) [61]. Giunchedi et al. formulated albumin microspheres loaded with piroxicam by
spray drying process. The yield of microspheres was up to maximum of 55%. The microspheres were of
irregular shape and their sizes were below 10 µm. The dissolution of drug was slower as about 70% of
piroxicam was released in 8 h. The in vivo bioavailability was found to be 1.8 times higher than commercial
eye drops of piroxicam [62].

5.5. Alginates
Alginates are derived from marine brown algae cell walls. It is anionic polysaccharide comprised of a chain
of (1–4)-linked β-D-mannuronic acid and α-L-guluronic acid in several arrangements of residues. Alginate is
a natural, biodegradable, and mucoadhesive polymer that does not produce toxicity in administration [63],
[64]. Alginates form hydrogels in the appearance of divalent cations such as Ca2 +. The alginate monomer
make up is documented to possess a great effect on the drug release characteristics of the various
preparations [65]. Balasubramaniam et al. developed as well as characterized scleral implants of
indomethacin using sodium alginate. The implants were further subjected to pharmacodynamic studies in
uveitis triggered rabbit eye-model. The pharmacodynamic investigations revealed an appreciable
refinement in different clinical criteria such as congestion, keratitis, flare, clot, aqueous cells and synechias,
in the implanted eye while comparing with the control eye in the rabbits [66]. Pandit et al. prepared in situ
gelling systems of indomethacin in sodium alginate. The drug content was uniform (i.e. 100 ± 5% of
indomethacin). It was observed that autoclaving caused a decrease in viscosities of the gels (up to 31–50%).
The reduction was much prominent at pH 7.4 suggesting nature of sodium alginate to coacervate at
physiological pH. Upon addition of gelation media alginate formed a polyelectrolyte complex, which were
least affected by dilution or ion- exchange reactions and keep their network in physiological conditions.
Besides the ionotropic gelling of alginate, its mucoadhesivity is also probably leads to prolongation of
retention period. It was anticipated that the dissolution of the gels in cul-de-sac would occur much slowly
than that observed in the in vitro experiments because of less resident volume of the lachrymal fluid in the
human eye, i.e. 7.5–10 µl [67]. Verma et al. prepared in situ gels of flurbiprofen by simple dispersion method
using sodium alginate and carbopol along with HPMC. The drug content was in the range of 98.3–103.1%
meant uniformity in all formulations. The alginate exhibited gelling features upon addition of bivalent
cations (sol to gel at physiological pH). The gel formulations were isotonic, as they did not cause any change
in blood cells (RBCs). Ocular irritation of the prepared formulation was assessed by hen's egg chorioallantoic
membrane method. The mean score indicated that developed formulations were non-irritant and well
tolerated. The results of anti-inflammatory activity against PGE2-induced ocular inflammation were also
good as parameters such as lid closure score; polymorphonuclear leukocytes migration was lower as
compared to their respective control. Thus, it was concluded that the prepared formulation is a robust
substitute to custom eye drops owing to its capability to improve bioavailability via its sustained precorneal
retention and capability to prolong the drug release and the readiness of its application offered and reduced
dosing frequency yielding good patient compliance [68]. Preetha et al. formulated and evaluated diclofenac

sodium gel using sodium alginate exploiting the notion of pH stimulated in situ gelation. Based on in vitro
characterization data it was suggested that developed formulation would likely to offer the increased
residence time and sustained drug release [69]. Subimol et al. formulated in situ gel formulation of
diclofenac potassium using sodium alginate and hydroxy propyl methylcellulose (HPMC). It was
summarized that the in situ gels had desirable characteristics for the localized delivery of the drug within
the eye [70]. Kumar et al. prepared microspheres containing naproxen sodium by ionic gelation method
employing sodium alginate, carbopol 974, and hydroxyl propyl methylcellulose K15 M (HPMC) as
mucoadhesive polymers. The microspheres were spherical in shape and homogenous in size (particle size
range of 129.7–395.9 µm). The maximum drug entrapment of 76.27% was observed at alginate (1% w/v) plus
carbopol (1.5% w/v).The drug release followed non-fickian pattern governed by swelling and relaxation of
polymer chain. Thus, they suggested that mucoadhesive microspheres could be designed for sustained
delivery of naproxen sodium and for improved patient acceptance [71]. Zhu et al. formulated thiolated
chitosan (TCS)-sodium alginate (SA) nanoparticles containing fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) by a
modified ionic gelation method. The average size of TCS-SA nanoparticles was 265.7 ± 7.4 nm. The prepared
nanoparticles were positively charged which were effective mucoadhesive on the negatively charged
cornea. TCS-SA nanoparticles had better delivery capability, suggesting they have good potential for
ophthalmic drug delivery applications. The in vitro cell uptake study and in vivo experiments provided
further evidence to support these conclusions [72]. Ibrahim et al. developed celecoxib loaded sodium
alginate nanoparticles by spontaneous emulsification solvent diffusion technique. The particle size, zeta
potential and incorporation efficiency of nanoparticles were 154.67 ± 5.06 nm, − 36.5 ± 4.7 mV and
75.38 ± 2.98%, respectively. The ophthalmic formulations containing sodium alginate nanoparticles
exhibited pseudoplastic behavior. The celecoxib liberated from all the preparations obeyed the Higuchi
model, suggesting diffusion as the release mechanism. The results from cytotoxicity studies indicated the
safety of nanoparticles formulation towards the eye [48]. Attia Shafie et al. formulated mucoadhesive
chitosan-sodium alginate nanoparticles of betamethasone sodium phosphate by ionotropic gelation
method. The developed nanoparticles were spherical with average particle size ranging 16.8 nm–692 nm.
The pH was close to that of tear fluid (5–7) which is compatible to ocular administration. Therefore, it was
suggested that chitosan alginate nanoparticles would be a promising system for the sustained release
delivery of betamethasone sodium phosphate to the posterior segment of the eye [73]. Recently Shinde et
al. fabricated chitosan-sodium alginate (CS-ALG) microspheres of azelastine hydrochloride using modified
ionotropic gelation technique. There was observed a change in particle size from 2.42 µm to 6.66 µm as the
concentration of CS: ALG ratio was changed from 3:1 to 1:2. All the microspheres were spherical and
positively charged due to the presence of chitosan. The drug release was initially higher (20–25% burst
release within 1 h) followed by sustained release over 8 h. The CS: ALG (3:1) ratio yielded highest mucin
binding efficiency of 65.79%. The eye scratching behavior of formulations were at par with marketed
product. Thus, from all the above mentioned results it was concluded that AZT-loaded CS-ALG microspheres
showed better efficacy in lowering conjunctivitis than marketed eye drops hence proved better in action
[74].

5.6. Hyaluronic acid
Hyaluronic acid also termed Hyaluronan and Hyaluronate (HA) and Sodium Hyaluronate (SA) are sodium
salt form of hyaluronic acid) is a biodegradable, biocompatible and viscoelastic linear polysaccharide of
broad molecular weight ranges (1000 to 10,000,000 Da). It is made up of alternatively positioned
disaccharide units of d-glucuronic acid and N-acetyl-d-glucosamine having (1 → 4) inter glycosidic linkage
and is scattered across the extracellular matrix, connective tissues, and organs of all higher animals.
Metabolism of HA takes place via the enzymatic hydrolysis by hyaluronidase (HAase) which prevails in
different mammalian tissues. The HA molecule is freely soluble in water, yielding a gel that serves as a
lubricant. It imbibes water too, rendering it hygroscopic and homeostatic features [75], [76], [77], [78].
Several researchers have investigated the release of hydrocortisone, which has been linked with backbone
of hyaluronate esters. Hyaluronate esters having approximately 50% methylprednisolone and 50% sodium
fluorescein were prepared as microspheres of size ranging 1–10 µm in diameter using spray drying
technique. The microspheres so formed showed sustained drug release, as time taken for all drug was 600fold higher than physical matrices of drug and polymers. Pharmacokinetic parameter like AUC was about 2.5
times higher in case of microspheres as compared to respective controls. These findings apparently
suggested that by employing macromolecular prodrug approach, therapeutic agents could be transported
for prolonged time with acquiring fewer peak drug concentrations and as a result yielding lowered systemic
side effects and greater bioavailability [79], [80], [81]. Kyyronen et al. prepared films and microspheres from
different esters of hyaluronic acid containing methylprednisolone. Drug-loaded films were formulated
through casting on glass plates. Circular matrices of 4 mm diameter were cut afterwards from dry films
using a cork borer. Every matrix had 420 ± 38 µg of methylprednisolone. After 8 h, all of the entrapped
methylprednisolone was liberated from ethyl ester films, whereas only approximately 40% was leached
from benzyl ester films. It was observed that the loss of drug in tear flow was minimum for films.
Interestingly the hyaluronate ester films offered near fixed tear fluid amounts till 8 h whereas microspheres
retained up to 4.5 h. Drug delivery systems composed of hyaluronic acid derivatives can sustain the
absorption time and improve the ocular delivery of other steroids [82]. Sahiner and Jia developed and
characterized submicron hydrogel HA particles. The researchers demonstrated least cytotoxicity while use
of these particles indicating innocuousness of such particulates in variety of drug delivery applications [83].
Sahiner et al. fabricated and evaluated cross linked HA hydrogel particles possessing promise for application
in different drug delivery applications [84]. Ilgin et al. synthesized and evaluated HA particles. It was
suggested that such particles have promise for drug targeting relevant to pharmaceutical and biomedical
areas [85]. Ekici et al. synthesized and evaluated HA hydrogel particles containing Trimethoprim and
naproxen. The investigators suggested utility of HA particles in drug delivery application in particular to
pH/thermo-responsive systems [86], [87]. Sahiner et al. synthesized and characterized porous as well as
modified HA particles containing trimethoprim and sodium diclofenac. Based on the in vitro drug release
findings the authors concluded that these particles offer drug release in linear manner. Therefore, the HA
particles could be fabricated by altering porosity for a number of drug delivery applications [88]. Bucolo et
al. compared release of methylprednisolone from hyaluronic acid derivative corneal shields (Hyalobend)

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0928493116304921?via%3Dihub

Page 16 of 48

2/19/24, 11:24 AM

against suspension of the drug. Ocular anti-inflammatory effect in the rabbit eye was also evaluated. A
constant amount of drug was maintained in tear fluid upon application of Hyalobend. The suspension
yielded higher concentration initially that faded away beyond 3.5 h. There was significant reduction in
conjunctival inflammation induced by sodium arachidonate by Hyalobend shields when compared with
control. Thus, Hyalobend corneal shields increased the retention of methylprednisolone in rabbit tear fluid,
enhanced the outreach into the aqueous humor, and decreased the initial signs of ophthalmic inflammation
[89]. Lajavardi et al. evaluated the use of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) liposomes dispersed in
hyaluronic acid gel for treatment of uveitis. This investigation exhibited appreciable lowering of
inflammation and proposed that the incorporation of hyaluronic acid even enhanced the efficacy and effect
span of liposomal VIP. The profile of an ophthalmic anti-inflammatory drug, which was not only influential
moreover devoid of custom side effects of steroids appeared promising [90]. Barbault-Foucher et al.
formulated poly-ε-caprolactone (PCL) nanospheres (NS) enveloped with hyaluronic acid (HA). The study
dealt with variety of approaches to link HA on NS surface. The HA attachment with NS was very strong in
the presence of surfactant like stearylamine or benzalkonium chloride in contrast to its poor binding with
PCL NS when used alone. Therefore, by employing an easy formulation procedure, it was feasible to procure
sturdy HA and uniform HA-covered NS [91]. Ibrahim et al. prepared nanoparticles containing
gatifloxacin/prednisolone employing Eudragit RS 100 and RL 100 and covered with hyaluronic acid. The
spherical nanoparticles had mean particle size ranging 315.2 to 973.65 nm and negatively charged. Eudragit
nanoparticles were readily enveloped using HA yielding enhanced ophthalmic bioavailability versus the
marketed eye drops. Thus, the prepared nanoparticles suspension could improve patient acceptance
because of its effortless application to the eye and its sustained action [92].

5.7. Miscellaneous
Several other materials of natural origin have been used for ocular delivery such as polysaccharides, amino
acids etc. Giunchedi et al. prepared pectin microspheres containing piroxicam by spray-drying technique.
The microspheres were spherical having average particle size below 10 µm. The incorporation efficiency
was in the range of 97–100%, although percentage yields was reported low (41–46%) which was attributed
to loss due to manufacturing by spray drying. The aqueous humor AUC values were also higher with
microspheres as compared to eye drops (22.06 ± 3.67 h µg/ml versus 6.45 ± 0.75 h µg/ml). Thus, the
microspheres provided sustained release of piroxicam in conjunctival sac and showed promise as potential
drug carrier in ocular delivery [93]. Sanzgiri et al. prepared and evaluated films and eye drops of gellanmethylprednisolone (MP). The films were prepared by casting into mould. The drug content was 87.5 ± 4 µg
in each film so casted. The drug release from gellan films were based on permeation of water into the
matrices, swelling of the matrix, hydrolysis of covalent ester bonds and diffusion of drug across the matrix
(n = 0.93). The eye drops also sustained the release at par with the films. To conclude, the MP ester of gellan
appears to offer an appropriate mode of prolonged MP delivery to the eye and a model for ocular delivery of
other polymeric prodrugs [94]. Balasubramaniam et al. prepared ion-activated in situ gel of Gelrite
(deacetylated gellan gum) containing indomethacin. The developed preparations were therapeutically

2/19/24, 11:24 AM

effective (in a uveitis stimulated rabbit eye model) and offered prolonged liberation of the drug over 8 h
span in vitro [95]. Liu et al. formulated ion-activated in situ gel of Gelrite-alginate containing matrine,
which has apparent anti-inflammatory activity. The viscosities observed were highest for Gelrite-alginate
(0.2: 0.8% w/w) i.e. − 671 ± 8.1 cP along with immediate gelation lasting longer. The in vivo human corneal
contact time was also found to be prolonged with combined solutions. There were not any ocular ill effects
or weird clinical symptoms to the cornea, iris, or conjunctivae upon application of gel. Therefore, the
Gelrite/alginate system may be employed as the in situ gelling vehicle for ocular drug applications [96].

6. Synthetic biodegradable polymers
Biopolymers having varying specific features are warranted for in vivo uses owing to the multiplicity and
intricacies of in vivo ambiences. In present age, synthetic biopolymers appears interesting substitutes for
biomedical uses because of the ensuing reasons: (1) though majority of biologically originated
biodegradable polymers have nice biocompatibility, few can stimulate an immune response within the
human body, probably one that could be surpassed by employing an adequate synthetic biopolymer; (2)
chemical alterations to biodegradable polymers are not easy; and (3) chemical changes are supposed to
bring about modification of the bulk characteristics of biologically derived biodegradable polymers. A
number of features may be procured and future alterations are feasible with aptly fabricated synthetic
biopolymers sans changing the bulk traits [97]. Some of the synthetic biomaterials that have been used as
carriers for anti-inflammatory agents are listed in Table 2.

6.1. Polylactide (PLA)
The PLA is a polymer of polyester class which has short aliphatic ester linked backbone. The presence of
extra methyl group confers the PLA more hydrophobicity than polyglycolide (PGA). The PLA has three
isomers such as D (+), L (−) and racemic (D, L) lactide [98]. The polymers of polyester category are degraded
by bulk erosion; the degradation products (lactic acid and glycolic acid) are non-toxic and cleared as carbon
dioxide and water through Krebs cycle [99].
Moritera et al. formulated microspheres of PLA by encapsulating a fluorescent dye, 1, 4-bis [2-(5phenyloxazolyl)]-benzene (POPOP). The drug delivery potential of these microspheres was assessed in
retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. By this study it can be said that surface modified microspheres could
be used for drug delivery to retina [100]. Further, Bourges et al. have studied the mechanism of localization
of PLA nanoparticles in the eyes of rats by employing two dyes viz. Rh-6G and Nile red. The researchers also
investigated the ability of releasing the confined drug in nanoparticles. The particles sizes of nanoparticles
were 140 ± 20 nm and 310 ± 40 nm for Rh-6G and Nile red, respectively. The release of Nile red from PLA
nanoparticles was observed about 0.4% after 30 days which indicated its affinity towards PLA. On the
contrary the Rh-6G was released rapidly from the nanoparticles. They have concluded that the
nanoparticles reached retina fast following injection and were observed to stay in retinal pigment
epithelium (RPE) cells even after 4 months. Thus the PLA nanoparticles could be used as drug carriers for
targeting to retina or RPE [101]. Beck et al. formulated and evaluated PLA nanoparticles containing
dexamethasone. The drug encapsulated in nanoparticles was found more effective in controlling
carrageenan induced rat paw oedema versus the marketed Decadron® [102]. Sakai et al. evaluated the
effects of intravenously administered PLA nanoparticles containing betamethasone phosphate on
experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis in Lewis rats. The clinical scores on day 15–31 of PLA nanoparticles
were significantly lower than drug or saline alone. Thus, the systemic application of these nanoparticles
may be promising in intraocular inflammations [103]. Kadam et al. have investigated the drug release
retarding ability of micro/nanoparticles of PLA containing triamcinolone acetonide for choroidal and retinal
delivery. Interestingly, the microparticles were found to sustain the drug release longer than nanoparticles
of PLA [104]. Similarly the capability of PLA micro/nanoparticles containing budesonide to sustain the drug
release was demonstrated by Kompella et al. [105]. Ibrahim et al. prepared and evaluated PLA nanoparticles
containing celecoxib. The inferences from cytotoxicity studies suggested non toxicity of nanoparticles with
percentage cell viability ranged from 90.7 to 99.5 [106]. Shin et al. developed an implant containing
triamcinolone acetonide and evaluated it for efficacy to treat experimental uveitis in rabbits. The implant
successfully alleviated the symptoms of inflammation upto 4 weeks [107].

6.2. Poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA)

This is a copolymer of lactide and glycolide. The PLGA along with PLA have been exploited for ocular drug
delivery in the form of implants, microparticles and nanoparticles. Moreover, PLGA has been approved by
FDA for human applications by virtue of its marvelous biocompatibility and degradation patterns [108]. Jain
et al. prepared fluorescent dye-chitosan-PLGA nanoplexes. The movement of stained nanoparticles and
mechanism of internalization was then studied. The findings indicated towards applicability of these
nanoplexes in ocular delivery [109]. The PLGA nanoparticles containing flurbiprofen were formulated and
evaluated. The nanoparticles appeared to be non-irritating to corneal surfaces as apparent from Hen's Egg
Test Chorioallantoic Membrane (HET-CAM) results. The drug entrapped in nanoparticles successfully
reduced the arachidonic acid induced ocular inflammation in rabbits [110], [111]. The steroid
dexamethasone and its acetate was successfully encapsulated in nanoparticles of PLGA and thermosensitive
polymer (PLGA)–polyethylene glycol) matrices. The particulate formulations have yielded higher area under
the concentration–time curves (AUC) against conventional eye drops [112], [113], [114], [115]. The PLGA
nanoparticles were formulated by combining with d-α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate
(TPGS) and employed for ocular delivery of dexamethasone [116]. The dexamethasone acetate implant made
up of PLGA was found to be well tolerated by rabbit eyes [117]. The diclofenac sodium confined in PLGA
nanoparticles have been well tolerated by rabbit eyes as apparent from findings of Draize test [118].
Similarly naproxen PLGA nanoparticles were formulated and characterized. The results of this investigation
suggested the probable application in ocular drug delivery [119]. The PLGA nanoparticles containing Sibuprofen (aka Dexibuprofen) were formulated by solvent displacement method. The results of this
investigation indicated non-toxicity upon ocular application [120]. Recently, Abrego et al. formulated PLGA
nanoparticles having pranoprofen and evaluated them for ocular tolerance, anti-inflammatory activity
against sodium arachidonate induced inflammation in the rabbit eyes. The inferences from the study
demonstrated excellent tolerance and control of eye swelling [121]. The microspheres encapsulating
dexamethasone were effective to reduce the ocular inflammation caused by injection of intravitreal
lipopolysaccharide [122]. Another steroid triamcinolone acetonide was incorporated to PLGA which was
then casted into films. The films were biocompatible and lowered postoperative eye inflammation [123].
Sabzvari et al. formulated and characterized PLGA nanoparticles containing triamcinolone acetonide. The
findings sustained ocular drug delivery of selected steroid in endotoxin-induced uveitis [124]. Verma et al.
developed an implant of PLGA in combination with polyepsilon caprolactone (PCL) containing difluprednate
engineered using PRINT® technology. The implant has shown extended drug release with effective control
of ophthalmic inflammation [125]. Recently, contact lenses loaded with PLGA nanoparticles containing
prednisolone were formulated and characterized. The nanoparticles have exhibited promise to sustain drug
delivery to the eye [126].

6.3. Poly-ε-caprolactone (PCL)
PCL is an aliphatic polyester crystalline polymer. Its applications as release rate retardant material are
because of its permeability to numerous drug molecules and slow degradation [127]. The NSAID
Indomethacin was confined in nanocarriers such as capsules, particulates and emulsions. The ocular

tolerance study findings suggested that these were well tolerated by rabbit eyes [128], [129]. The PCL
nanospheres containing flurbiprofen were prepared and characterized. The results of in vitro studies
indicated that PCL may sustain delivery of flurbiprofen to the eyes [130], [131]. The celecoxib was also
entrapped in biodegradable nanoparticles and their efficacy was assessed versus arachidonic acid induced
inflammation in rabbit eyes. The particulates successfully controlled the parameters of ocular inflammation,
thereby appearing promising for delivery of celecoxib to the eye [106], [132]. The PCL was copolymerized
with methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) and diclofenac was added to make polymeric micelles. These micelles
were devoid of toxicity to corneal surfaces. The micelles yielded improved movement of drug across cornea.
The AUC values of diclofenac in aqueous humor were higher than suspension alone. Thus, it could serve as a
potential drug delivery system in ocular therapeutics [133]. Shi et al. synthesized chitosan grafted methoxy
poly(ethylene glycol) and PCL polymeric micelles for ocular delivery of diclofenac. The hydrogel was
observed to be having low cytotoxicity. The movement of dye (Nile Red) across the transcorneal epithelium
suggested improved penetration of polymeric nanocarriers. The aqueous humor concentration for
diclofenac nanosupension was higher than corresponding aqueous suspension [134]. Recently a
thermosensitive triblock PEG-PCL-PEG (PECE) hydrogel containing diclofenac sodium was formulated and
evaluated. The in situ gel was found to be non-irritant to various parts of eyes and with enhanced ocular
bioavailability of diclofenac as compared to conventional eye drops [135], [136]. Zhang et al. formulated
methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) and PCL polymeric micelles for ocular delivery of diclofenac. The hydrogel
was less cytotoxic towards L-929 and HCEC cells. The aqueous humor concentration for hydrogel entrapped
diclofenac was higher than corresponding aqueous suspension. Moreover, the thixotropic behavior of gel
suited its ocular application [137]. Another triblock polymer system was prepared using poly(ethylene
glycol)-poly(ε-caprolactone)-g-polyethyleneimine. A dye namely fluorescein diacetate (FDA) was
incorporated into micelles. The deeper penetration of FDA loaded micelles following 30 min of application
suggested the capability of such polymeric micelles to deliver hydrophobic molecules to the eye [138]. The
steroidal drug triamcinolone acetonide was incorporated into PCL implants. The implant released the drug
and there was no sign of inflammation till 4 weeks of insertion. Therefore, it may be used as safe alternative
to existing eye drops [139]. The same drug was encapsulated in nanoparticles of pentablock copolymers
comprising polylactide–polycaprolactone–polyethylene glycol–polycaprolactone–polylactide. Based on in
vitro results the researcher suggested these nanoparticles application for ophthalmic delivery of drugs
[140]. Recently, Triamcinolone acetonide was embedded to PCL microfilms. The findings of this study
recommend use of such engineered microfilm for the treatment of retinal ailments [141]. The
dexamethasone was added to implants and evaluated tor retention and safety to ocular membranes. The
implants showed prolonged retention due to slower degradation of PCL [142], [143].

6.4. Polyalkyl cyanoacrylates (PACA)
The PACA is a polymer comprised of alkyl cyanoacrylate units. This polymer has bioadhesive characteristics
thereby expression of strong binding to polar surfaces including living tissues. Wood et al. studied the
distribution of (14C) labeled poly(hexyl) cyanoacrylate nanoparticles in ocular tissues. The elimination

Page 22 of 48

2/19/24, 11:24 AM

kinetics of these nanoparticles was observed linear with an approximate half-life of 20 min. Similarly,
poly(butyl)-2-cyanoacrylate nanoparticles were radiolabeled using 111Indium-oxine by Fitzgerald et al. and
their residence in the eye was investigated. The half-life in this study was reported as 10 min which was
attributed to release of radiotag. The authors recommended the use of such nanoparticles for ophthalmic
delivery of lipophilic drugs [144], [145]. A more exhaustive study conducted by Diepold et al. compared the
distribution of radiolabeled particles in healthy and eyes with inflammation of rabbits. The conjunctiva was
the tissue with highest retention. It would be appropriate to mention that the concentration of
nanoparticles in inflamed eyes was approximately 3–5 folds higher than healthy eyes at initial time points.
Hence, these may be used as drug carriers for steroids [146]. Das et al. formulated
poly(isobutylcyanoacrylate) nanoparticles and characterized for variety of parameters. Based on in vitro
results the researchers suggested utility of PIBCA nanoparticles for mucoadhesion to ocular surfaces [147].
The steroidal drug tramcinolone acetonide was encapsulated into poly(isobutylcyanoacrylate)
nanoparticles. The findings of study indicated sustained ocular delivery of triamcinolone acetonide [148].
However, the PACA's ability to cause disruption of integrity of biomembranes limits its application.

6.5. Polyanhydrides and polyorthoesters (POEs)
Polyanhydrides are a category of polymers that has 2 carbonyl groups linked by an ether bond. Leong et al.
investigated the biocompatibility of bioerodible implants of polyanhydrides with rabbit corneas. The
implants were devoid of any sort of inflammatory response till 6 weeks of application [149]. The
polyorthoesters are hydrophobic polymers with hydrolytically labile orthoester bonds. The POEs containing
dexamethasone and 5-fluorouracil were found biocompatible upon subconjunctival injection to rabbit eyes.
The addition of dexamethasone also slowed down POE degradation along with sustained drug release [150].
Similar study by Einmahl et al. have demonstrated innocuousness of synthesized POEs and retention in
rabbit eyes till 6 months without appreciable deterioration [151].

7. Inflammation sensitive biopolymers
The immune response is mainly represented by inflammation through the agency of several components of
which polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) being the principal [152]. The key feature of inflammation is
presence of free radicals. Thus, the polymer which lyse upon reaction to free radicals will facilitate drug
release at the place of inflammation [153]. Nobuhiko et al. have developed hydrogels (cross-linked with
glycidylether) and polymeric matrices of hyaluronic acid which released the entrapped drug upon
stimulation by inflammation mediators (like hydroxyl ions) [154], [155]. Recently, Lu Toit et al. developed a
chitosan–poly(ε-caprolactone) nanosystem and evaluated its suitability for delivery to the ophthalmic
posterior portion. The findings of present investigation indicated improved control of inflammation,
increased movement across the corneal laminas and smaller particle sized well tolerated by the eyes. Thus,
such smart polymers may facilitate the drug delivery as well as may help to diminish dose requirements of
anti-inflammatory agents in ocular therapeutics by virtue of their responsiveness towards inflammation
mediators [156].

8. Conclusion
Polymeric substances play a vital part in the sustained drug delivery. Specially, biodegradable polymers
have been elaborately attempted for ophthalmic therapeutics in the latest decades. In present review, we
have compiled mostly preparation, characterization and uses of biodegradable polymers of natural origin as
well as synthetic ones. The utility of biodegradable polymers as carriers for anti-inflammatory drugs to the
eye has been discussed. Two main merits of polymeric drug delivery systems like improving drug
bioavailability and avoiding side effects are important in ophthalmic drug delivery. The growth of novel
biodegradable polymers has achieved outstanding pace in the past few years. These polymers will be
beneficial in delivering novel therapeutic substances like genes, therapeutic antibodies and bioactive
proteins. Thus, fabrication of new biodegradable polymeric systems is presently in research for site-specific
delivery of drug molecules.

Pharmacologic Activities of Plant-Derived Natural Products on Respiratory Diseases
and Inflammations
Deepak Timalsina, Krishna Prasad Pokhrel, and Deepti Bhusal

Abstract
Respiratory inflammation is caused by an air-mediated disease induced by polluted air, smoke, bacteria,
and viruses. The COVID-19 pandemic is also a kind of respiratory disease, induced by a virus causing
a serious eﬀect on the lungs, bronchioles, and pharynges that results in oxygen deficiency. Extensive
research has been conducted to find out the potent natural products that help to prevent, treat, and man‐
age respiratory diseases. Traditionally, wider floras were reported to be used, such as Morus alba,
Artemisia indica, Azadirachta indica, Calotropis gigantea, but only some of the potent compounds
from some of the plants have been scientifically validated. Plant-derived natural products such as
colchicine, zingerone, forsythiaside A, mangiferin, glycyrrhizin, curcumin, and many other compounds
are found to have a promising eﬀect on treating and managing respiratory inflammation. In this review,
current clinically approved drugs along with the eﬃcacy and side eﬀects have been studied. The study
also focuses on the traditional uses of medicinal plants on reducing respiratory complications and their
bioactive phytoconstituents. The pharmacological evidence of lowering respiratory complications by
plant-derived natural products has been critically studied with detailed mechanism and action. Howev‐
er, the scientific validation of such compounds requires clinical study and evidence on animal and hu‐
man models to replace modern commercial medicine.

1. Introduction
Respiratory inflammatory disorders comprise several air-mediated diseases such as chronic bronchitis,
pulmonary diseases, and asthma. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung inflammato‐
ry disease that is the 5th leading cause of death worldwide [1]. Respiratory inflammation is mainly
caused by airway disease, characterized by several complications such as coughing, sneezing, and
shortness of breath [2]. The disease can act on both upper and lower airways and worsens the other dis‐
eases including rhinosinusitis and tightness of the chest [3]. There are multiple problems associated
with respiratory inflammation. The upper inflammation is associated with the common cold, pharyngi‐
tis, sinusitis, laryngotracheitis, and epiglottitis, and lower inflammation is associated with bronchiolitis,
bronchitis, and pneumonia [4]. The inflammation is also induced by a respiratory virus that infects the
epithelial lining of the airways and replicates in it [5]. This inflammation normally leads to type 1 in‐
flammation. Inflammation in the healthy airway results in the activation of antiviral state and clearance
of viral infection [6, 7], but in chronically inflamed airways, the response against the virus may impair
resulting in sustained inflammation [8, 9] and reduced ability of viral clearance [10, 11]. The acute ex‐
acerbations may be triggered by several allergens, pollutants, cold and dry air, smoke inhalations, and
several pathogenic bacteria in the airways [12]. Asthma is one of the chronic respiratory diseases
marked by reversible airway constriction, eosinophil infiltration, increased mucus production, and non‐
specific hyperresponsiveness of the airways [13].
There are several treatment methods for reducing complications of respiratory inflammation that in‐
clude oxygen therapy, steam therapy, draining mucus from the lungs, and taking antihistamines and
bronchodilators. Several steroidal and nonsteroidal drugs are used to lessen down inflammation. Inhaled
corticosteroids (ICS) in combination with long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) are recommended in many
countries. Long-acting bronchodilators such as salmeterol and formoterol can be used in asthma ac‐
cording to the rate of intrinsic activity. Some ultraclass drugs such as β-2 agents [14], olodaterol [15],
vilanterol [16], carmoterol, PF-610355, LAS100977, and AZD3199 are recommended for therapy
against respiratory diseases. Many of the plants such as Adiantum capillus-veneris, Aegle marmelos,
Aerva javanica var. javanica [17], Albizia lebbeck, Alhagi maurorum, and Alhagi maurorum were
used in respiratory disorders by traditional healers and indigenous people [18]. There are many plantderived compounds of diﬀerent classes such as alkaloids, flavonoids, glycosides, lignans, polyphenols,
and saponins that are studied for their activities against respiratory disease and inflammation. Some
compounds like mangiferin, zingerone, glycyrrhizin, piperine, and forsythiaside A are promising and
have evidence of positive results in an animal study. Despite the promising eﬀect of plant-derived nat‐
ural products, the extensive study of clinical evidence and their toxicological aspect is still lacking.
Only some of the compounds have been isolated, and a lesser number of experiments have been done in
the human model. This review is aimed at collecting and analyzing the traditional approach, reported
natural products, and their pharmacological evidence on respiratory diseases and inflammations with
suﬃcient research gaps and recommendations.

2. Methodology
The information on respiratory diseases and inflammations had been retrieved from an extensive litera‐
ture survey. Systematic literature had been searched by using an online database such as Google Schol‐
ar, PubMed, SciFinder, ScienceDirect, Mendeley, and Scopus. Literatures were searched in the online
database using keywords such as “Respiratory inflammation”, “Ethnomedicine and respiratory dis‐
eases”, “Bioactive compounds and respiratory disease”, and “Respiratory drugs”. The cross-referenced
articles were also retrieved. Various books, thesis, proceedings, and news articles were secondary
sources of information.

3. Current Clinical Practice and Approved Drugs
Respiratory inflammatory diseases like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are
usually treated with eﬀective modern medicines of diﬀerent classes. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (NSAIDs) is a class of drug that has been used eﬃciently and commonly in the inhibition of the
cyclooxygenase enzyme. The past study showed the prescription of triple therapy for the treatment of
pulmonary diseases [19] which suggested the use of a long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) and long-acting
muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) in combination with inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) [20]. There is a major
development in treating COPD and asthma by the ICS-LABA-LAMA therapy. The most common pre‐
scriptions nowadays are LABA and ICS discovered by the physician in Europe [21]. The common uses
of 22% ICS and 39% bronchodilators are for lower symptoms and 46% ICS and 67% bronchodilators
are for greater symptoms. Due to the limited eﬀect of this medication, a trial for triple therapy is tried in
every patient [22]. NSAIDs, bronchodilators (β2-adrenoreceptor (AR) agonists, muscarinic receptor
antagonists, and xanthines) [23], and corticosteroids [24] are a highly recommended initial therapy for
most patients individually or in combination with one of the other classes [25]. Nonselective COX in‐
hibitors for reducing respiratory inflammation include aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, and diclofenac, and
selective COX inhibitors include celecoxib, lumiracoxib, etoricoxib, valdecoxib, and rofecoxib [26].
Among diﬀerent bronchodilators, fast-acting and short-acting albuterol, terbutaline, and fenoterol are
eﬃciently used, yet long-acting agonists salmeterol and formoterol are best for therapy. Some drugs of
class ultra-long-acting β2 agents indacaterol [14], olodaterol [15], vilanterol [16], carmoterol, PF610355, LAS100977, AZD3199, etc. had been prescribed for achieving one dose daily [27]. The use of
a combination of drugs using β2 long-acting and antimuscarinic controls the transforming growth factor
(TGF)-β1-mediated inflammation in COPD. The novel antimuscarinic agents such as QAT370, gly‐
copyrronium (NVA237), aclidinium, GSK573719, CHF5407, BEA2180BR, TD4208, PF452297,
RBx343E48F0, trospium, and dexpirronium are generally used at a high dose for a prolonged duration
of action [27]. Anti-inflammatory and bronchodilator action of xanthines such as bamiphylline, enpro‐
fylline, isbufylline, and doxophylline is reported to be used in the treatment of asthma and COPD. The
safer use of xanthines inhibits the family of phosphodiesterase (PDE3 and 4) enzymes for long-term
improvement in lung function [28]. Diﬀerent NSAIDs like ibuprofen are used in COVID-19 infection,

but there is a lack of studies that shows the association between the use of NSAID and COVID-19
severity. Currently, known antiviral agents like lopinavir/ritonavir and remdesivir have a high aﬃnity to
the viral enzyme and could inhibit the synthesis of the nitrogenous base resulting in the inhibition of
RNA replication through premature termination of the virus [29]. Anti-inflammatory drugs like corti‐
costeroids had a role in the significant reduction of in-hospital mortality by COVID-19 [30]. During
this pandemic of COVID-19, several pulmonary complications from this disease were reported such as
mucormycosis and pulmonary aspergillosis [31]. These are life-threatening fungal infections and have a
role in complicating pulmonary conditions like asthma, bronchiectasis, and COPD. These pulmonary
infections are found to attack patients with low immunity. Many researchers and health personnel as‐
sumed it was due to the excessive use of corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are used for the treatment of
COVID-19 patients which in turn reduces immunity due to which the patients are prone to be infected
by mucormycosis and aspergillosis [32]. Losmapimod, p38, a subfamily of mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK) inhibitor, is widely studied and used safely as a single IV infusion of 1 to 3 mg doses.
There are no severe eﬀects reported except headache, nausea, and fatigue ([33]). Various reports sug‐
gested that this can be appropriate in treating COVID-19 patients [34]. The recent trial in the mouse
model supported a similar result [35]. Besides this, p38 was able to cause a pathogenic role in asthma
and COPD. The adverse factors causing these diseases activate the p38 which in turn amplifies lung
inflammation. The clinically trialed anti-interleukins like benralizumab, daclizumab, reslizumab,
MEDI-528, mepolizumab, and lebrikizumab showed improvement in patients by decreasing eosinophils
and other exacerbations [36]. The clinical trial of benralizumab revealed the eﬀects in reducing
eosinophil and improved lung function but with some headache and nausea eﬀects [37]. Number of tri‐
als had been conducted for treating upper airway disorders such as allergic rhinitis, nasal polyps, and
chronic rhinosinusitis for which several therapeutics such as omalizumab, mepolizumab, dupilumab, a
monoclonal antibody targeted toward IgE, an anti-IL-5 agent, anti-IL-4, and IL-3 had been used. The
outcomes of the trials were positive [38].
Several other modern drugs have been discovered and synthesized in the laboratory with promising re‐
sults. However, the success of low-molecular-weight drugs remains low as respiratory inflammation
diseases are complex in etiology. The critical target molecule that is directly associated with the disease
process has not been found yet. The plant can be the potent source of such medicine as plants have di‐
verse compositions and complex molecular associations. Recently available techniques are eﬀective but
associated with several complications such as cost, demand, and availability. Thus, a new kind of eﬃ‐
cient and easily available therapeutics should be introduced for developing new kinds of drugs against
respiratory inflammation.

4. Ethnomedicinal Practice on Treating Respiratory Complications
Several plants were reported to be used for their anti-inflammatory properties that can be used in acute
as well as chronic bronchitis. Ethnomedicinally, the number of plants had been reported based on in‐
digenous knowledge of people and the practice of traditional healers. Plants such as Morus alba [39],

Dicliptera bupleuroides, Adiantum capillus-veneris, Trichodesma indicum, and Viburnum grandiflo‐
rum were reported to be traditionally used in Pakistan and Korea for treating whooping cough and the
common cold. The decoction of leaves of Dicliptera bupleuroides was known to apply externally in the
throat for managing the cough by the local people of Kashmir of Pakistan [40]. The milky latex and
flower paste of Calotropis gigantea found in the Terai forest of western Nepal were reported to be tak‐
en orally for the management of cough and bronchitis [41]. Some of the reported plants acting against
respiratory disorders, based on traditional knowledge and practices, have been listed in Table 1.

The number of compounds (Table 2) derived from plants was reported for the prominent therapeutics
against respiratory inflammation. The flavonoids such as kuwanone E, kuwanone G, and norarto‐
carpanone from Morus alba [61], sakuranetin from Baccharis retusa [62], and pinocembrin (5,7-dihy‐
droxyflavanone) from Alpinia katsumadai have been reported to act against respiratory inflammation.
The polyphenols such as curcumin (1,7-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-1,6-heptadiene-3,5-dione)
from Curcuma longa rhizome[63, 64], resveratrol from grapes [65], and luteolin from Lonicera japoni‐
ca [66] were reported to act against respiratory inflammation. The other classes of plant-derived com‐
pounds such as alkaloids [67], coumarins [68], and triterpenoids, saponins, and steroids [69–72] were
reported to be eﬀective against several kinds of inflammations. Colchicine is a plant alkaloid derivative
that could be used as a substitute for commercial colchicine. Colchicine concentrations diﬀer from or‐
gan to organ, and colchicine content was demonstrated to be influenced by plant age, seasonality, and
location. Colchicine was found to reduce neutrophil elastase concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage
fluid in ex-smokers with COPD [73]. Some of the structures of the potent bioactive compounds are giv‐
en in Figures 1 and 2.

ties should be taken into the clinical trial in a sample population.

6. Mechanism of Action of Plant-Based Natural Product
The lung inflammation involves the activation of inflammatory cells such as eosinophils, lymphocytes,
macrophages, and neutrophils, which serve as the source of diﬀerent inflammatory mediators such as
tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), interleukins (IL-4, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-5), histamine, prostaglandins,
nitric oxide, and leukotriene. The release of these inflammatory mediators causes several abnormalities
in the lungs and their function [156]. Natural products target the epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(EMT), oxidative stress, fibroblast activation, inflammatory injury, metabolic regulation, and extracellu‐
lar matrix accumulation. The basic mechanisms involved are the NF-κB, TGF-β1/Smad, PI3K/Akt, p38
MAPK, Nrf2-Nox4, and AMPK signaling pathways [157]. The plant flavonoid such as eriodictyol was
reported to serve as the anti-inflammatory agent in the lungs which regulates the Nrf2 pathway and in‐
hibited the expression of inflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, etc. [86]. The flavonoids
kaempferol and luteolin reduced the LPS-induced activation of the MAPK and NF-κB pathways and
also reported to inhibit the ICAM-1, TNF-α, SOD, KC, and neutrophil inflammation. This compound
was also found to involve in the reduction of the activity of superoxide dismutase and catalase and fur‐
ther reduces the lipid peroxidation and oxidative damage in the lung tissue [158, 159]. A natural prod‐
uct such as sakuranetin was also reported to reduce the TNF-α, eosinophils, M-CSF, RANTES, IL-5,
and IL-1β and inhibited the NF-κB, MMP-12-positive, and MMP-9-positive cells and also increased the
TIMP-1 expression to serve as anti-inflammatory activities in the lungs of the elastase-treated animals
[62]. Several compounds such as epigallocatechin, gallocatechin gallate, berberine, berbamine, copti‐
sine, and dicentrine were reported to involve in the inhibition of viral replication, by inhibiting the viral
life cycle in the host and act against the viral-induced respiratory inflammations [160]. The 1,8-cineol
isolated from the essential oil of Eucalyptus globulus leaves was studied for its ability to reduce the
expression of NF-κB target gene MUC2 [161]. The 3-methoxy-catalposide had been studied for its abil‐
ity to inhibit the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 in
RAW264.7 cells stimulated by LPS. This compound also suppressed the release of nitric oxide (NO)
and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). This compound significantly reduced the activation of inflammatory
genes such as interleukins IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α and inhibited the activation of nuclear translocation
of NF-κB and AP-1 [162]. Nepitrin, matte flavonoside G, rutin, etc. were reported to inhibit the influen‐
za virus by damaging the viral membrane, by blocking the viral penetration into the cells, and by sup‐
pressing neuraminidase in both bacterial and viral infections [163]. Thus, the possible mechanism of
action of natural products to reduce the inflammation and diseases in the respiratory system could be by
the inhibition of bacteria and viruses and also by the protease-antiprotease balance, NF-κB activation,
oxidative stress, and MAPK pathways. The simple flowchart of the mechanism involved is in Figure 3.

7. Some Promising Natural Products and Their Pharmacology
Based on the in vitro and in vivo study, the number of plants based natural products has been studied.
Some of them are discussed in detail.

7.1. Piperine
Piperine is a major compound and is a class of alkaloid found in the Piper nigrum fruits. Piperine was
reported to be used in pain management, fever, influenza, hypotension, vascular cell modulation, saliva‐
tion, stimulation of appetite, antimicrobial, insecticidal, and chills ([164]). This compound was found to
enhance the bioavailability of diﬀerent drugs. Cosupplementation of piperine with resveratrol was re‐
ported to increase its eﬃcacy by enhancing bioavailability [165]. Piperine was reported for its dose-de‐
pendent activities in reducing the allergic responses, involving sneezing, nasal rubbing, redness of the
nose, etc. [166]. This compound was reported to act as an immunomodulatory and antiallergic eﬀect on
ova-albumin-induced rhinitis in the rat, by significantly ameliorating the sneezing, coughing, and red‐
ness induced by sensitizing. The histopathological section of nasal mucosa showed the attenuation of
redness and disruption of alveoli and bronchioles [167]. The antitussive activities of plant extracts con‐
taining piperine showed the good enhancement of the antitussive eﬀect [168]. The inhibition of tumor
growth in the lungs (B16F-10 melanoma cells) was observed after administration of piperine in the
mice. The piperine was found to be 100% cytotoxic to melanoma cells shown by histopathology of
lungs, resulted in a significant decrease in tumor mass. The alveolar passage and pleura were tumor-free
in the piperine-treated mice [169]. The investigation of the eﬃcacy of curcuminoids co-administered
with piperine was measured by measuring the serum level of glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde
(MDA) in sulfur-mustard-induced chronic pulmonary complications and showed the significant in‐
crease in GSH and decrease in MDA indicating improvement in COPD status and health-related quality
of life (HRQoL) [170]. There are several other pharmacological activities of piperine that can add to
the management of several diseases including respiratory inflammation.

7.2. Forsythiaside A

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8505070/

Page 11 of 32

Pharmacologic Activities of Plant-Derived Natural Products on Respiratory Diseases and Inflammations - PMC

2/19/24, 11:09 AM

Forsythiaside A is the pharmacologically active monomer of phenylethanoid glycoside. It is the main
active ingredient isolated from the fruit and leaves of Forsythia suspensa. This compound was reported
as a potent component that controls inflammation caused by influenza A virus infection by the molecu‐
lar mechanism through receptor downregulation of the RLRs signaling pathway. It was reported for
anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-infective activities that explained major biological activities
[171]. In a recent study, the anti-inflammatory activity in the lungs of mice had been demonstrated
well. Forsythiaside was reported to suppress the inflammatory action of cytokines involving (TNF-α,
IL-6, and IL-1β) via activating Nrf2 and inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway in a dose-dependent
manner. The number of neutrophils as mediators of inflammation and macrophages was reduced which
typically reduced inflammations in the lungs of cigarette and smoke-induced mice [154]. It was report‐
ed to act as an immunomodulatory agent which showed an increment in anti-inflammatory cytokines
after treatment and restrained the activation of T cell immune response [172]. Forsythiaside A could be
developed as a possible therapeutic candidate against respiratory complications.

7.3. Mangiferin
Mangiferin, a C-glucosyl xanthone, is a natural polyphenolic compound found in Mangifera persici‐
formis, Mangifera indica, Anemarrhena asphodeloides, Salacia hainanensis, and Mangifera persici‐
formis, along with other plant species [173]. The major source of mangiferin was reported from bark,
fruits, roots, and leaves of the papaya tree, peels and kernels of mango fruits, and the leaves, heartwood,
and bark of the mango tree [174]. It was reported to reduce the pathological condition that occurred due
to inflammation and was eﬀective in inhibiting inflammatory signaling and treating sepsis with acute
lung injury (ALI). Mangiferin suppressed respiratory burst and dramatically reduced the expression of
NF-κβ and proinflammatory cytokines like IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α [175, 176]. An in vivo experiment in
sepsis-induced mice showed the dose-dependent action of mangiferin upregulated the action of HO-1
(heme oxygenase-1) and mediated the inflammation [177]. Mangiferin had a functional eﬀect on the
contraction of tracheal rings. It increased NOS3 protein levels and cGMP levels that prevented muscle
contraction in the guinea pig. This preclinical experiment suggested mangiferin to be a potent compo‐
nent for treatment in human lung diseases [178]. It was found to be eﬀective as an immunotherapeutic
agent against allergic asthma. The reported results confirmed that mangiferin inhibited PGD2 expres‐
sion, mediated the level of LTC4, attenuated Th2 cytokines, and displayed a significant role in reducing
asthma in a mouse model [179]. The recent studies on mangiferin found the antiallergic properties us‐
ing a mouse model with allergic rhinitis (AR). The use of mangiferin had a prominent eﬀect in anti-in‐
flammation on nasal tissues. This study further demonstrated the potential of mangiferin in treatment
for AR by activating the Nrf2/H-O1 signaling pathway and inhibiting NF-κB [180]. Mangiferin also
prevented the formation of the proinflammatory leukotriene LTB4 and decreased the expression of
prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 [173, 181].

7.4. Glycyrrhizin
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8505070/

Page 12 of 32

Pharmacologic Activities of Plant-Derived Natural Products on Respiratory Diseases and Inflammations - PMC

2/19/24, 11:09 AM

Glycyrrhizin is a triterpene glycoside made up of one molecule of 18-glycyrrhetinic acid and two glu‐
curonic acid molecules of the composition 18-beta-glycyrrhetinic acid-3-O-beta-D-glucuronopyra‐
nosyl-(1→2)-beta-D-glucuronide [182, 183]. It is a key active ingredient reported from the root of Gly‐
cyrrhiza glabra [70]. To examine the eﬀects of glycyrrhizin, a significant anti-inflammatory component
found in G. glabra was introduced on mice with OVA-induced asthma; it resulted in the alleviation of
asthma diseases by lowering the airway hyperreactivity to methacholine, OVA-induced airway constric‐
tion, and lung inflammation including significant eosinophil infiltration [70]. Glycyrrhizin was reported
for its antiviral properties against a wide range of RNA and DNA viruses. By observing both in vitro
and in vivo experiments, glycyrrhizin had been shown to aﬀect SARS-CoV-2 replication, adsorption,
and penetration [184]. Glycyrrhizin dosing could be employed as COVID-19 adjuvant or prophylactic
therapy [185]. The data showed that applying glycyrrhizin to the nasal and oral cavities could be the
first line of defense against SARS-CoV-2 infection in upper respiratory tract cells. Recent clinical stud‐
ies of anosmia, hyposmia, and dysgeusia in COVID-19 patients reported the nasal and lingual epitheli‐
um serves as a gateway for SARS-CoV-2 entrance [186, 187]. This hypothesis is supported by the fact
that glycyrrhizin possesses excellent physical features such as amphiphilicity and the capacity to change
the characteristics of lipid bilayer membranes.

7.5. Curcumin
Curcumin is a polyphenolic compound that is biologically active and found in the roots of Curcuma
longa. It is the active component having wide pharmacological benefits. This compound was reported
to suppress inflammation and showed pulmonoprotective eﬀects. It inhibited the NF-κB and mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways. Treatment with curcumin attenuated the secretion
of TNF-α, IFN-α, and IL-6 and deals eﬃciently with the complications [188]. The eﬃcacy of curcumin
was reported by various pieces of evidence in lung diseases and was found to be eﬀective and reliable
to be used in various respiratory complications like asthma, COPD, lung cancer, and other lung in‐
juries. It was reported to reduce the degree of inflammatory cells and alleviates dysregulation [189].
Curcumin was reported to hold the ability to bind with receptors, blocked the entry of the virus into the
cells, and interfered with its replication. Lung inflammation due to COVID-19 can be mediated by its
uses. Some reports from in silico analysis supported the issue. This potential serves to recommend its
implication in therapeutics in COVID-19-induced respiratory complications [190].

7.6. Zingerone
Zingerone is the major component found in the ginger root to about 9.25%. This compound was report‐
ed to be closely related to the vanillin from vanilla and eugenol from clove [191]. This compound was
reported as a nontoxic compound bearing various pharmacological importance. This compound was
extensively studied for its eﬀect on lung injuries. It significantly lessened the pulmonary edema, attenu‐
ated the amount of TNF-α and IL-β in BALF, and inhibited proinflammatory cytokine release in acute

Pharmacologic Activities of Plant-Derived Natural Products on Respiratory Diseases and Inflammations - PMC

2/19/24, 11:09 AM

lung injury in mice [151]. The hepatoprotective eﬀect of zingerone had been studied in the LPS-in‐
duced hepatic injury in mice in terms of liver histology, liver function marker, and several other inflam‐
matory markers such as TNF-α, TLR4, and iNOS parameters. The zingerone-treated group showed sig‐
nificant improvement in liver histology, decreased endotoxin level, improved liver function markers,
and downregulation of mRNA expression of TNF-α, TLR4, and iNOS indicating better anti-inflamma‐
tory activities.

7.7. Vitexin
Vitexin (apigenin-8-C-β-D-glucopyranoside) is a flavone glycoside of apigenin found in food and medi‐
cinal plants such as the hawthorn leaf [192], bamboo [193], buckwheat [194], Passiflora [195], and
Echinodorus [196]. Vitexin was reported as a significant polyphenol present in foods such as mung
beans [197], which are frequently utilized in traditional Chinese medicine [192]. In the gastrointestinal
tract, vitexin is poorly absorbed. It is rapidly eliminated from the bloodstream, primarily eliminated in
the urine and bile [198]. This compound is reported to have very poor absolute oral bioavailability and
is quickly and broadly disseminated throughout the body. The buildup of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
exacerbated inflammatory reactions by boosting the release of proinflammatory cytokines and inflam‐
matory cell infiltration [199]. When compared to vehicle-treated mice, vitexin administration reduced
LPS-induced ROS levels by 44%. Vitexin therapy reduced neutrophils and the production of proinflam‐
matory cytokines. This compound reduced pulmonary edema and protein concentration in the alveoli.
The activity of Nrf2 and HO-1 was significantly increased after treatment with vitexin. Vitexin also
boosted the activity of its target gene, heme oxygenase (HO)-1, via activating nuclear factor erythroid2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) [103].

8. Conclusion and Future Perspective
In this review, the drawbacks and limitations of currently adopted treatment procedures and available
drugs have been highlighted. This study also reported the several plant species that are being used in
the treatment of respiratory complications in the traditional medicinal system based on traditional
knowledge and indigenous knowledge. The reported bioactive compounds and their mechanism of ac‐
tion have been critically analyzed for possible therapeutic compounds. Some of the plant products are
promising against respiratory diseases and can be the best source of alternative medicine. Although,
some clinical shreds of evidence have been reported for some of the compounds, there needs to be an
extensive study on the toxicological aspect and interaction with other therapeutics. The detail studies on
the formulations, forms of doses, evaluation of pharmacokinetic parameter, and safety are necessary.
The future study should focus on the identification and isolation of more eﬀective compounds, their
mechanism of action, and formulations. This study can facilitate the newly discovered compounds to

enter a clinical trial. Therefore, it is concluded that further research on the traditionally used plants and
plant-derived products could lead to the discovery of a new kind of therapeutic drug of high potential
and interest.

Abstract
The growth of cancerous cells and their responses towards substantial therapeutics are primarily controlled
by inflammations (acute and chronic) and inflammation-associated products, which either endorse or
repress tumor progression. Additionally, major signaling pathways, including NF-κB, STAT3, inflammationcausing factors (cytokines, TNF-α, chemokines), and growth-regulating factors (VEGF, TGF-β), are vital
regulators responsible for the instigation and resolution of inflammations. Moreover, the conventional
chemotherapeutics have exhibited diverse limitations, including poor pharmacokinetics, unfavorable
chemical properties, poor targetability to the disease-specific disease leading to toxicity; thus, their
applications are restricted in inflammation-mediated cancer therapy. Furthermore, nanotechnology has
demonstrated potential benefits over conventional chemotherapeutics, such as it protected the
incorporated drug/bioactive moiety from enzymatic degradation within the systemic circulation, improving
the physicochemical properties of poorly aqueous soluble chemotherapeutic agents, and enhancing their
targetability in specified carcinogenic cells rather than accumulating in the healthy cells, leading reduced
cytotoxicity. Among diverse nanomaterials, polyester-based nanoparticulate delivery systems have been

potentials of various polyester nanomaterials (PLGA, PCL, PLA, PHA, and others)-based delivery systems

1. Introduction
Cancer-associated mortality is one of the main reasons for death worldwide, even though many approaches
have been established as a potential tool in cancer therapy, including chemotherapy, surgery,
immunotherapy, and radiotherapy [1]. Since cancer is considered a cellular-inherent genetic disease, most
of the treatment approaches primarily emphasize directly killing the tumor/carcinogenic cells; however, the

major drawback lies with multidrug resistance of the cancerous cells leading to lower efficiency of cancer
therapy [2], [3]. Moreover, inflammation has been a major factor responsible for diverse phases of
development and progression of malignant cells associated with various types of cancer [4], [5], [6]. In this
aspect, chronic inflammation is majorly responsible for immunosuppression, thus providing a favored
microenvironment for tumor development and progression, tumorigenesis, and metastasis. In addition, the
inflammatory responses could be significantly triggered by chemotherapeutics or anticancer therapies [7],
[8]. However, acute inflammation stimulates the antitumor immune response. So, it is mostly accountable
for the death of tumor or cancerous cells, whereas therapy-incited chronic inflammations lead to drug
resistance and insist in cancer progression [9], [10]. Nowadays, it has been noticed that cancer-associated
inflammation, including chronic, dysregulated, tenacious, and uncertain, has become a prime factor in
increasing the risk of malignancies [11], [12].

1.1. Molecular pathways responsible for inflammation-associated cancer
The association between inflammation and cancer is quite complicated. Generally, cancer and
inflammations are associated with two major pathways, intrinsic and extrinsic pathways (Fig. 1). In brief,
the intrinsic pathway is stimulated by gene-related events, including initiation of several types of
oncogenes through mutation, reorganization or augmentation of chromosomes, and the deactivation of
tumor-suppressing genes, overall leading to neoplasia. On the other hand, the extrinsic pathway is usually
responsible for the augmentation of inflammation or infection situations leading to enhanced risk of
evolving cancer at specific biological sites such as colon, breast, prostate, lungs, pancreas, and others. These
two pathways congregate, ensuing in the stimulation of transcription factors, primarily the nuclear factorκB (NF-κB), signal transducers and STAT3 (transcription 3 activators), and major inflammatory cytokines
such as interleukins (IL; IL-1β, IL-6, IL-23) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) within the tumor cells
[13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18]. Among all molecular pathways, NF-κB and STAT3 have been found as the most
fundamental types that are combinedly triggered within the cancerous cells and are critical collaborating
factors for maintaining the malignancy phase. Moreover, their targeting genes are responsible for various
extents of cell life, including cell proliferation, endurance, apoptosis, and damage repairment [13], [19].
Studies have shown that the tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) are the major sources of inflammatory
cytokines within the tumor microenvironment. TAMs induce malignancy in the tumor cells in different
ways, mostly by releasing cytokines, growth factors, and matrix-deteriorating enzymes [20], [21]. Apart
from these factors, various types of chemokines, such as CCL-(2/5/22), and CXCL-(1/8/12/13/17/22), have
been identified in neoplastic cells. Amongst these, CXCL1 and associated moieties (CXCL-(2/3/80, or IL-8)
exhibit a major role in the evolution of melanoma as they significantly stimulate the growth of neoplastic
cells, promotes inflammation, and induces angiogenesis [22], [23].

Fig. 1. Schematic representation of various inflammation-mediated signaling pathways associated with the
development and progression of cancer. Inflammation and cancer development are mainly associated with
two pathways: extrinsic and intrinsic pathways (A). The extrinsic pathway is primarily responsible for the
expedition of inflammation towards carcinogenesis and involves various factors. On the other hand, the
intrinsic pathway assists in establishing cancer/tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, the intrinsic
pathways are responsible for the segregation and dysfunction of active and efficient immunocytes. The
various oncogenic mediators of the tumor include STAT3, β-catenin, p53, NF-κB, and others, which are
triggered within the tumor microenvironment leading to cancer development. Also, these mediators
upregulate the release of chemokines and cytokines, mainly responsible for the increase in the polarization
of immunosuppressant cells, including TAMs, Tregs, MDSCs, and TANs, within the tumor sites (B).

1.2. Therapeutic approaches for targeting inflammatory pathways
Tumor development and progression are considered major characteristic outcomes of chronic
inflammations [4]. Therapy-mediated chronic inflammations frequently give rise to enduring cancerous
cells through resistance to successive treatment approaches, including chemotherapy and radiotherapy [6].
As a conventional therapeutic approach, anti-inflammatory drugs have been established as an effective
platform for tumor or cancer prevention and treatment; however, few adverse effects such as coagulation or
excessive bleeding have restricted their unlimited usage in cancer treatment [24]. Recently, various
therapeutic approaches have been established to hinder the inflammatory cells and associated products,
significantly tested in preclinical/clinical tumor models. For example, statins potentially abridged the risk of

Polyester nanomedicines targeting inflammatory signaling pathways for cancer therapy - ScienceDirect

2/19/24, 10:44 AM

progression of numerous cancer types by employing anti-inflammatory and other biological activities [25],
[26]. Also, neutralization of IL-11, IL-17A, and IL-22 could significantly hinder colonic tumorigenesis at an
initial stage [27], whereas COXs inhibitors such as aspirin or celecoxib reduced tumor development and
metastasis [28]. additionally, although immune checkpoint blockers have been found clinically efficient in
exhibiting long-term responses for treating a few solid tumors, metastatic melanoma, renal cell cancer, and
non-small-cell lung carcinoma however most of the cancer patients did not respond to these treatments
due to numerous reasons [29]. These limitations could be overcome by developing a targeted therapeutic
approach, possibly by establishing nanotechnological approaches.
Nanotechnological treatment approaches or nanomedicines act as a potential tool in cancer therapy as these
approaches significantly improve the physicochemical properties of chemotherapeutic agents, thus limiting
chances of organ toxicity and enhancing their therapeutic index, whereas retaining their
therapeutic/biological activities and increase their targetability to the specific disease sites [30]. Drug
incorporation and their delivery through nanocarriers significantly enhance drug solubility and avoids
degradation and metabolic degradation, leading to enhanced pharmacokinetic and biodistribution. In
addition, the targetability of the chemotherapeutic agents to specific carcinogenic cells enhances through
passive or active mechanisms with reduced organ toxicity improvised intracellular permeation, assisting in
overcoming the limitation of multi-drug resistance [31], [32].
Nanoparticles (NPs)-based drug delivery systems have been extensively applied due to their diverse
characteristics, including their shape and size, hydrophilic characteristics, and surface charge properties,
which allow them to act as potential carriers for the targeted delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs [32].
These nanomedicines have several features, including synthesizing various kinds of nanosized materials
that could easily be developed into films and capsules. Secondly, NPs, because of their nanosized
dimensions and adequate design, could easily permeate through physiological barriers like the blood-brain
barrier, thus enabling their systemic stability. Thirdly, chemotherapeutic drug regimens could be
significantly co-encapsulated within the NPs with high stability [33]. Fourthly, the nano-engineered NPs
(polymeric NPs) could specifically carry and deliver the antibodies or aptamers with high targetability,
leading to reduced toxicity to the healthy and normal cells [34].
Apart from various advantages, the therapeutically active NPs have shown toxicity mostly due to the lower
biocompatibility of the nanomaterials used during their design and fabrication. Different nanocarriers such
as liposomes, nanoemulsions, polymeric micelles/NPs, carbon NPs, metallic NPs, and dendrimers can be
internalized within cells through various routes: oral, inhalation, intravenous, subcutaneous, and others.
Specifically, the inhalable drug-loaded NPs can readily pass into the interstitium through the epithelial
tissues of the respiratory tract and either directly access the blood flow or lymphatic paths. Consecutively,
the bloodstream delivers the drug-loaded NPs to the gastrointestinal tract, central nervous systems, hepatic
systems, kidneys, and other organs. As soon as the NPs are internalized within the cells, they can lead to
organ-specific toxicities. Amongst all NPs types, carbon nanotubes have exhibited more toxicity towards
lung tissues, sometimes also towards the gastrointestinal tract, central nervous systems, and blood. In

addition, the metallic NPs have shown toxicity as they could accumulate in the hepatic and kidney
microenvironment and thus could be carcinogenic for the gastrointestinal tract and central nervous
systems. Likewise, silicates are categorized by a protuberant accretion in the liver and lung, leading to
fibrosis and significant adverse effects [35], [36]. Various synthesis approaches, including physical,
biological, and chemical have been reported earlier for the fabrication of nanomaterials [37], [38]. Fig. 2
describes various methods included under the categories of physical, chemical, and biological strategies for
the fabrication of polyester nanomaterials.

Amongst several NPs-based delivery systems, the polyester-based NPs systems including, poly- (lactic-coglycolic acid) (PLGA), poly-(ε-caprolactone) (PCL), poly-(lactic acid) (PLA), poly- polyhydroxyalkanoates
(PHA), and others have been widely applied in drug delivery, tissue engineering, and diagnostic applications
because of their superior biocompatibility, hemocompatibility, and biodegradability [39]. Moreover, these
polyester-based nanomedicines that are applied in the development of chemotherapeutics are expected to
assist the researchers in resolving the clinical/pre-clinical issues associated with cancer therapy (Fig. 3). This
review summarizes the potential applications of various types of polyester-based nanomaterials in the
effective management and treatment of inflammation-mediated cancer.

Fig. 3. Polyester nanomaterials-based targeted delivery systems against various molecular targets
responsible for inflammation-induced cancer. These biodegradable and biocompatible therapeutic moieties
can be efficiently used to target multiple tumor-intrinsic signaling that is majorly responsible for regulating
and promoting the immunosuppressed tumor microenvironment. These nanomaterials assist the effective
delivery of loaded drug/bioactive moieties to the targeted tumor or cancer sites by enhancing their passage
through various biological or physiological barriers. Also, these nanomaterials have been found
therapeutically effective in managing multiple types of inflammation-mediated cancer, including
glioblastoma, lung cancer, hepatic cancer, pancreatic cancer, colon cancer, ovarian cancer, melanoma, and
others.

2. Therapeutic implications of various polyester nanomaterials in targeting
inflammation-mediated cancer
Nanoparticles (NPs) applicable for drug delivery are mostly composed of different kinds of biodegradable
materials, including lipids, natural or synthetic polymers, metallic composites. They have shown diverse
advantages in accomplishing targeted drug delivery of hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs/bioactive due to

ultra-small size, larger surface area-to-mass ratio, and higher responsiveness. In addition, the NPs are
occupied by cells more competently than the bigger macromolecules. Thus, they specifically target the
carcinogenic or tumor cells through enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) mechanism showed by
solid tumors compared with healthy and normal tissues. Moreover, the polyester materials, mainly PLGA,
PCL, PLA, and PHA, are biocompatible, biodegradable, multi-functionalization, precise formulation methods,
and eco-friendly behavior and thus have gained significant consideration for various biomedical and
theranostic applications [39]. The polyester nanomaterials, including PLGA, PCL, PLA, PHA, and others,
illustrated in Fig. 4, have been extensively used in designing various targeted drug/bioactive delivery
systems for tumor or cancer therapy (Table 1). This segment summarizes the reported works of literature
that significantly demonstrated the anticancer activities of various polyester nanomaterials-based delivery
systems targeting inflammatory pathways for efficient cancer therapy.

2.1. PLGA-based nanomaterials
PLGA is an FDA (US Food and Drug Administration) approved GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe)
copolymer, which is mainly composed of two monomeric components (lactic acid and glycolic acid) and
exists in L-form and D-form, respectively. The distribution of these monomers typically influences the
degradation rate of PLGA. Due to its superior degradation rate, the sequenced PLGA is more potent than
random PLGA for attaining controlled drug delivery. Moreover, the glassy nature of PLGA allows it to exhibit
superior solubility in numerous organic solvents. Furthermore, PLGA degrades more rapidly than its
monomeric components, and more importantly, the drug delivery processes are majorly affected due to
their elasticity. Thus, PLGA-based nanocarriers with a rigid-core exhibit augmented cell internalization [40].
Bharali et al. assessed the anticancer effects of tetra-iodothyroacetic acid-loaded PLGA NPs (TTA-PLGA-NPs)
both in vitro (MCF-7 cells) and in vivo (BALB/c nude mouse model) against doxorubicin-resistant breast
cancer. In vitro studies showed that the TTA-PLGA-NPs significantly inhibited angiogenesis and tumor-cell
proliferation more efficiently than free TTA. In vivo studies showed that free TTA or TTA- PLGA-NPs inhibited
tumor weight by 3–5-folds [41]. Satapathy et al. prepared PLGA-based silver NPs conjugated with
quinacrine (drug), formed QN-PLGA-AgNPs, using single-emulsion solvent evaporation technique, and
evaluated their anti-tumor effects against oral cancer cells (H-357) and cancerous stem cells (OSCC). In vitro
results disclosed that QN-PLGA-AgNPs showed greater cytotoxicity against the carcinogenic cells than the
normal epithelial cells by enhancing BAX/BCLXL level and hindering the cell growth in the S phase along
with DNA degradation. Furthermore, QN-PLGA-AgNPs inhibited angiogenesis and caused apoptosis within
the treated cancer cells [42].
Sims et al. fabricated a co-polymer-based nanoparticulate system composed of PLGA, MPG, and PEG for
targeting vimentin (VM) and evaluated their cytotoxicity effects against human cervical carcinoma (HeLa)
cells. Results showed that the hybrid polymeric NPs internalized within the HeLa cells (monolayer) after a
treatment of 24 h more specifically than the unmodified NPs. Moreover, it was noticed that the hybrid
polymeric NPs inhibited angiogenesis and caused cytotoxicity against the HeLa cells in a dose-dependent
manner [43]. Zhu et al. developed inhalable oridonin-encapsulated PLGA-microspheres (OD-PLGAMs) using

the electrospraying method and evaluated their anticancer activity against chemical carcinogens-induced
lung cancer rat models. The inhaled OD-PLGAMs exhibited higher anti-lung cancer effects by inhibiting
angiogenesis and enhancing lung cancer cell apoptosis [44].
Yang et al. described the viability of methoxy-poly (ethylene glycol)-b-PLGA NPs (mPEG-PLGA NPs) for
releasing nitric oxide that could potentially induce angiogenesis. The NO-mPEG-PLGA NPs caused no
specific cytotoxicity against various cells, including normal cells (human umbilical vein endothelial cells
(HUVEC), fibroblasts, and epithelial cells) and cancerous cells (A549, C6, and MCF-7), showing its
biocompatibility. However, NO-mPEG-PLGA NPs exhibited potential anti-angiogenic activity and apoptosis
in cancer cells, tested in rat aorta, in a sustained-release manner [45]. Sousa et al. established bevacizumabincorporated PLGA NPs (BZPNs) to evade the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and lessen organ toxicity. BZPNs
were administered intranasally in CD-1 mice to instigate the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
profiles. The administration of BZPNs showed enhanced bioavailability of BZ as compared to pure BZ. In
addition, BZPNs also enhanced the penetration and the residence time of BZ within the brain. BZPNs-treated
glioblastoma multiforme mice model showed reduced tumor growth and a higher anti-angiogenesis than
free BZ (Fig. 5) [46].

Almnhawy et al. prepared Trachyspermum ammi seed isolated essential oil-based PLGA NPs (TPNs) and
showed that it caused apoptosis in the HT-29 cells. Further, it was noticed that the TPNs significantly
overexpressed the level of apoptosis genes (Cas-9 and BAX) downregulated the BCL-2 (anti-apoptosis gene),
leading to confirmation that the anticancer activity of TPNs was due to apoptosis. TPNs exhibited high
targetability as they specifically suppressed the growth of HT-29 cancer cells and exhibited antiangiogenesis effects. Their cytotoxicity was found to be dose- and time-dependent against the HT-29 cells
[47]. Chittasupho et al. developed LFC131(peptide)-linked sodium carboxymethyl cellulose-layered PLGA
NPs (LFC131-DOX-SPNs) for targeted delivery of DOX against CXCR4-overexpressed lung cancerous cells. As
compared to the untargeted NPs, LFC131-DOX-SPNs exhibited improved binding and cellular uptake within
the A549 lung cancerous cells in a dose-dependent manner. It was noticed that alteration of DOX-NPs
surface by coupling with LFC131 peptide specifically decreased the initial release rate and presented

sustained release behavior [48].
Mansor et al. encapsulated chemokine stromal cell-derived factor-1α (SDF-1α) into PEG-PLGA NPs for
achieving sustained release behavior. Results showed that protein-polymer electrostatic interaction
influenced the entrapment efficiency of proteins. It was noticed that at pH 7.4, the amount of PLGA-COOH
NPs significantly affected the level of lysozyme release. It was expected that the initial release of SDF-1α
could be useful for establishing a concentration gradient into a hydrogel for instantly inducing chemotaxis
of glioblastoma cells [49]. Da Silva et al. developed biocompatible PEG-PLGA NPs. Further, these NPs were
co-loaded with IR-780 Iodide (near-infrared dye), DOX, pIC (poly (inosinic:cytidylic acid)), R848
(immunoadjuvant), MIP3α, and CCL20 (chemokine) and evaluated their theranostic properties. The release
of drugs exhibited sustained release behavior. Additionally, the hybrid NPs significantly triggered the
secretion of IL-12 from dendritic cells, signifying that these cells had been stimulated. The hybrid NPs
demonstrated superior cytotoxicity against the TC-1 tumors and MC-38 tumors than the free DOX.
Moreover, hybrid NPs-treated mice exhibited greater CD3 + and CD4 + T cells within the tumor [50]. Pisani et
al. synthesized Pluronic 127 coated-PLGA NPs through the microfluidics-mediated nanoprecipitation
method and conjugated with CXCL12. It was noticed that the CXCL12-conjugated NPs were safe and did not
trigger the release of inflammatory cytokines within the THP-1 monocyte. The CXCL12-conjugated NPs
specifically affected CXCR4-mediated chemotaxis but do not hinder CCL5/CCR5-induced chemotaxis of THP1 monocytes [51]. Sasaki et al. developed 2-deoxy-D-glucose-incorporated PLGA NPs (2DDG-PLGA NPs) and
evaluated their antitumor activity against hepatocellular carcinoma in mice models. The 2DDG-PLGA NPs
augmented the T-cell trafficking; thus, it induced antitumor immunity and cytotoxicity in the carcinogenic
cells. The 2DDG-PLGA NPs amplified the release of chemokines (CXCL-9/10) within the xenografted liver
tumors. Also, the adverse effects associated with 2DDG were significantly reduced [52]. Ni et al. fabricated
complex scaffolds comprised of chitosan, triamcinolone acetonide, collagen-I, and PLGA-microspheres,
formed CH-C-TA-PLGAMs, and these hybrid scaffolds inhibited the stimulation of macrophage cells,
chemokine-assisted cell proliferation, and fibrogenesis. The stability of the drug was significantly enhanced.
Furthermore, it was observed that a higher concentration of CH-C-TA-PLGAMs enhanced macrophage
survival, confirmed through CCK-8 assay. Also, a higher concentration of CH-C-TA-PLGAMs inhibited the cell
viability of L929 cells [53].
Niu et al. established DOX-encapsulated PLGA NPs and evaluated their potential anticancer activity in the
B16-F10-induced mice model. Results disclosed that the surface-modified DOX-PLGA NPs with acidsensitive PEG moieties and mannose enhanced the accretion of DOX within the tumors increased the DOX
uptake through TAMs but reduced drug distribution within the mononuclear phagocyte system like liver.
Furthermore, in vivo outcomes displayed that DOX-PLGA NPs significantly controlled the growth of tumors
more efficiently than the pure DOX. However, it exhibited minimal effects over the macrophage population
in the liver and spleen of treated mice. DOX-PLGA NPs exhibited cytotoxicity against both B16-F10
melanoma cells and J774A.1 macrophage cells, both mice models [54].
Zou et al. developed rabies virus glycoprotein (RVG) peptide-linked PTX hybrid PLGA-NPs to manage

malignant glioma. The hybrid NPs demonstrated poor uptake by the neurons but exhibited superior
targetability for brain TAMs with enhanced sustained release and tumor-specified toxicity. The hybrid NPs
showed efficiency for anti-glioma activity over the human glioma cells. Moreover, the hybrid NPs
significantly improved the level of IL1α, IL6, and TNFα were as compared to the control groups, signifying
inhibited invasion and growth of tumors and enhanced the anti-glioma effects [55]. Badkas et al. conjugated
PEG-b-PLGA NPs with a Herceptin® (commercially available antibody) for targeting the HER2-positive
breast cancerous cells and evaluated their efficiency in cellular uptake and immunogenic responses (using
human dendritic cells and murine macrophages). Herceptin®-conjugated polymeric NPs significantly
enhanced biocompatibility and targetability. The conjugated NPs reduced immune cellular uptake and
expression of TNF-α and IL-6. In addition, the cellular uptake of all NPs types was found to be more in SKBr3 cell lines than in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cell lines [56]. Zhou et al. fabricated iron oxide (Fe3O4) based
PLGA NPs (IOPNPs) superficially modified with anti-CD206 monoclonal antibodies using the O/W-emulsion
method. CD206-IOPNPs and IOPNPs significantly indorsed TNF-αexpression, inducible nitric oxide synthase
(iNOS), and IL-1β within the macrophages [57]. Koerner et al. demonstrate the utmost adjuvant effects
Riboxxim (double-stranded (ds) RNA adjunct) incorporated within the PLGA NPs. Results showed that
Riboxxim-PLGA NPs potently activated human and murine dendritic cells and enhanced tumor-specified
CD8 + T cellular response. In addition, Riboxxim-PLGA NPs promoted the production of type-I-IFN in murine
and in human dendritic cells, leading to enhanced antitumor effects and propagation of antigen-specific
CTLs22. Also, the level of IL-(1β/6,12) and TNF was significantly enhanced [58].
Molavi et al. evaluated the activity of TLR4 ligand and 7-acyl lipid A, transported through PLGA NPs, over the
dendritic cells and Treg cells. Additionally, the immune-modulatory and anticancer activities of 7-acyl lipid
A-conjugated PLGA-NPs (ALA-PNPs) combined with JSI-124 (STAT3 inhibitory agent) were evaluated in a
B16 mouse melanoma model. ALA-PNPs delivery to the dendritic cells significantly decreased the repressive
effect of Treg cells over the T-cells. Combinatorial delivery of JSI-124 and ALA-PNPs in tumor-bearing mice
showed a reduction in tumor growth and enhanced the efficiency of cancer immunotherapy [59].
Alshamsan et al. explored the effects of encapsulated siRNA/ polyethyleneimine (PEI) and PEI- stearic acid
(SA) polyplexes in PLGA NPs (NPs) for knockdown of STAT3 in the dendritic cells, leading to induction of B16
cancer cell death. In the adapted medium, the hybrid NPs-treated B16. F10 cells exhibited higher STAT3 and
lower CD86 expression signifying reduced functioning. Moreover, the toxic effects of the hybrid NPs showed
a concentration-dependent behavior; thus, this approach could be significantly used as efficient cancer
immunotherapy [60].
Su et al. synthesized Stat3/siRNA conjugated PTX-loaded PLGA NPs (SsPPNs) and evaluated their potential
applications against A549 and A549/T12 (A549-derived PTX-resistant) cells. Results showed that SsPPNs
potentially suppressed the expressions of Stat3 and caused more cellular apoptosis in the treated cancer cell
lines than control groups. Also, it was noticed that the sensitivity of A549 cells towards PTX was
comparatively more than the A549/T12 cells. It was concluded that SsPPNs significantly downregulated
Stat3 expression, leading to cellular death of the two cancer cells [61]. Das et al. developed PEI-PLGA NPs
(PPNs) for targeting STAT3/siRNA moieties in A549 cells (in vitro) and tumor-bearing BALB/c mice (in vivo).

STAT3/siRNA-PPNs showed anti-proliferative effects in the treated A549 cells, degenerated tumor growth in
the treated BALB/c mice and enhanced cellular uptake through the blood-brain barrier. STAT3/siRNA-PPNs
also reduced the IL6 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression, concurrently enhanced the
Caspase 3 activity, induced apoptosis, and detained cells at G1/G0 phase, thus leading to repression of
tumor growth in lung cancer-induced mice model [62].
Cavalcante et al. developed methotrexate/ hyaluronic acid-incorporated PEI-PLGA NPs (MET/HA-PNs),
further conjugated with PD-L1 antibody (MET/HA-PD-L1-PNs) and assessed their anti-cancer and
immunomodulatory activities in breast cancer tumor microenvironment. Results demonstrated that both
MET/HA-PNs and MET/HA-PD-L1-PNs significantly altered the tumorigenic course through tumor
microenvironment immunomodulation, thus reducing the size of tumor and metastases. Moreover, the
nanoparticulate system specifically downregulated the STAT3, and NF-κB genes decreased the levels of IL10, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) and CCL22 [63]. Bao et al. co-delivered Alantolactone (AL) and
Erlotinib (ET) using PLGA NPs to manage pancreatic cancer effectively. The AL/ET-PLGA NPs significantly
suppressed the STAT3, and EGFR signaling pathways and activated the ROS-mediated p38 MAPK pathway,
leading to enhanced anticancer activity in pancreatic cancer therapy. AL/ET-PLGA NPs enhanced the antiproliferation effects than ET alone, probably due to the double hindering effects over EGFR and STAT3
signaling [64].

2.2. PCL-based nanomaterials
PCL is another essential aliphatic polyester material approved by FDA for diverse biomedical applications. It
is a semi-crystalline material with superior biocompatibility and biodegradability, thus showing negligible
toxicity. It is mostly used in tissue engineering applications due to its customizable characteristics. Although
PCL provides similar drug encapsulating behavior as PLA, its usage as nanocarriers for efficient drug delivery
is limited due to its slow degradation rate within the biological system [65].
Dordunoo et al. demonstrated that taxol-loaded poly(e-caprolactone) (T-PCL) microspheres exhibited slowrelease behavior and potentially caused vascular regression and hindered angiogenesis, evaluated using the
chick Chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model [66]. Zheng et al. formulated DOX-loaded mPEG-PCL micelles
using the self-assembling method. DOX-mPEG-PCL micelles exhibited higher cytotoxicity and increased cell
uptake against B16-F10 cells. The subcutaneous administration of DOX-mPEG-PCL micelles into C57BL/6
mice enhanced their survival time and reduced tumor growth with negligible systemic toxicity. It was
considered that the antitumor potentials of DOX-mPEG-PCL micelles could be due to their capability of
inhibiting intra-tumoral angiogenesis and induction of cellular apoptosis [67]. Kim et al. developed
sorafenib-loaded PCL-based biliary stents. They evaluated the anticancer effects against cholangiocancerous cells (HuCC-T1 cells) in vitro and tumor-induced mice xenograft model. The drug-loaded films
exhibited reduced growth and proliferation of the carcinogenic cells and followed dose-dependent behavior.
Also, the level of MMP-2 expression of HuCC-T1 cells progressively reduced based on drug concentrations.
Mice-treated with drug-loaded films showed significant inhibition in tumor growth and initiation of

apoptosis followed by necrosis in tumor cells. Moreover, the drug-loaded films exhibited anti-angiogenesis
effects, tested in HUVECs in conditioned medium, and potentially reduced the expression of STAT5 and ERK
signaling [68].
Several studies have been reported regarding the administration of liposomal DOX using pegylated (Doxil®,
Lipodox®) and unpegylated (Myocet®) delivery systems [69]. Hu et al. fabricated 3-dimensional complex
scaffolds composed of sodium alginate and PCL using the co-electrospinning technique to improve cancer
stem cells. Cells isolated from these complex scaffolds and individual polymer matrices demonstrated
suitable drug resistance, epithelium-mesenchymal conversion, angiogenesis, and higher stemness. Results
of qPCR studies showed that the levels of VEGF and MDR1 genes up-regulated complex fibers [70]. Conte et
al. synthesized PEG-PCL conjugated anti-FLT1 hexapeptide (aFLT1) NPs and formed aFLT1-PEG-PCL NPs. The
hybrid NPs exhibited antiangiogenic activity against the HUVEC. Further, DTX was incorporated into aFLT1PEG-PCL NPs, and its therapeutic potentials were estimated. DTX-aFLT1-PEG-PCL NPs exhibited the highest
cytotoxicity in HUVEC and MDA-MB-231 cells. aFLT1-PEG-PCL NPs were potentially more anti-angiogenic
than the free peptide, and further DTX improves the anti-angiogenic activity and anticancer properties of
these NPs synergistically [71]. Jiang et al. incorporated two chemotherapeutic agents (silibinin and IPI-549)
into aminoethyl anisamide-PEG-PCL NPs and evaluated their therapeutic potentials in anticancer therapy.
The mice-treated with drug-loaded polymeric NPs exhibited enhanced anti-tumor efficiency and apoptosis
within the 4T1 breast cancer cells-derived tumors. Moreover, conjugated NPs exhibited enhanced antitumor
effects by exerting antifibrotic, anti-angiogenesis, and tumor cell proliferation inhibition [72].
Liang et al. developed an NP-mediated delivery system consisting of PEG-b-PCL, PCL-b- poly (2-aminoethyl
ethylene phosphate) for targeted siRNA delivery within the macrophages. It was observed that the silencing
of CC-chemokine ligand 18 (CCL18) within the macrophages significantly repressed the migration of MDAMB-231 cells. Compared to the naked siCCL18, the hybrid NPs system protected the siCCL18 from RNase
degradation. Furthermore, THP-1-instigated macrophages showed greater cellular uptake of the hybrid
conjugated NPs, leading to down-regulation of the CCL18 expression and exhibiting no cytotoxicity (Fig. 6)
[73].

Bushnell et al. developed implantable PCL-based scaffolds and evaluated its potential role as a base for
targeting interleukin-10 (IL-10), CCL2, and CXCL12 in employing immune response within the tumor cells
and breast cancer cells through overexpression lentivirus. In vivo results showed that the lentivirus
transported from the PCL scaffolds attained sustained transgene expressions. Furthermore, there was a
significant reduction in the IL-10 lentiviral expression; however, no effect was observed in the case of
CXCL12 and CCL2 expression, leading to a targeted reduction in the growth of tumor cells. In conclusion,
these findings suggested an immunotherapeutic approach for the targeted therapy against metastatic
tumors [74]. Nie et al. fabricated an FA-loaded gene delivery system comprised of a self-assembled
polymeric matrix of 1,2-Dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium propane (DOTAP), mPEG-PCL-mPEG, and FA-PEGPCL-PEG-FA (FA-DPPP), targeted for the effective delivery of plasmids CKb11 (pCKb11; immunostimulant

chemokine). FA-DPPP-CKb11 NPs stimulated the level of inflammatory genes (CXCL9, IRF5, NOS2, IL-6a, and
IL-12) within macrophages. Moreover, the delivery of pCKb11 using FA-DPPP NPs caused in enhanced
release of CKb11 through the tumor cells that efficaciously triggered T cells repressed the M2 polarization in
macrophage cells, endorsed the development of dendritic cells, enabled the permeation of NK cells,
repressed the penetration of immunosuppressant cells within the tumors and also hindered tumor
angiogenesis, overall leading to suppression of cancer cell progression [75].
Annabi et al. evaluated the anti-metastatic activity of PCK3145 (a synthetic peptide that could decrease the
experimental metastases in the skeleton and growth of tumors in the prostate region). PCK3145
significantly hindered adhesion of HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells over hyaluronic acid and laminin-1,
stimulated the detaching of CD44, inhibited secretion of MMP-9, enhanced RhoA signaling, and improved
the expression of MT1-MMP gene and proteins. Thus, it was concluded that the anti-metastatic activities of
PCK3145 were related to the downregulation of MMP-9 secretion and probable down-regulation of its cell
surface binding to CD44 [76]. Gu et al. developed PTX-loaded activatable protamine and linked it with PEGPCL NPs, formed PTX-P-PEG-PCL NPs, and evaluated its potential effects in anti-glioblastoma therapy. The
PTX-P-PEG-PCL NPs significantly improved MMP-based cellular accretion in the C6 glioma cells. The PTX-PPEG-PCL NPs treated mice model showed specific uptake by the C6 tumor cells and was evenly distributed
within the glioma cells, confirming its potential targetability to the glioma cells, thus enhancing the overall
anti-glioblastoma effect [77]. Wang et al. developed a nano-micellar system comprising PEG-PCL, PLG*LAG
(MMP-2-degrading peptide), and polyarginine r9 (cationic cells permeating peptide) for targeted delivery of
siRNA within the carcinogenic cells. The siRNA-based nanomicelles significantly improved the blood flow
and cellular deposition at the tumor microenvironment. The main mechanism observed included shedding
of the layer of PEG when activated by tumor overexpressed MMP-2 followed by the exposure of
polyarginine r9 peptide, leading to improved cellular uptake of siRNA [78].
Danafar et al. developed d,L-sulforaphane incorporated mPEG-PCL micellar nanoformulations (SF-mPEGPCLNs) using nanoprecipitation process and evaluated their anticancer effects against MCF-7 cells.
Compared to pure SF and blank nanoformulations, SF-mPEG-PCLNs exhibited superior toxicity in the MCF-7
cells. Moreover, SF-mPEG-PCLNs specifically up-regulated the MMP-9, BCL-2, BCL-XL, BAX, BAK, and GAPDH
levels and induced apoptosis in the MCF-7 carcinogenic cells [79]. Drewes et al. demonstrated the
anticancer effects of PCL-nanocapsules (PNCs) or PNC-loaded acetyl eugenol (AL-PNCs) against B16F10induced melanoma in mice model. It was observed that the PNCs or AL-PNCs treated melanoma cells
showed superior internalization, thus showing their enhanced targetability when pre-treated with
neutrophils isolated from C57Bl/6 mice. Interestingly, the neutrophils in PNCs or AL-PNCs treated melanoma
cells significantly improved the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which caused cell death.
Furthermore, PNCs or AL-PNCs administration reduced the level of TGF-β and pro-tumor chemical
intermediaries (MMP-9, VEGF, IL-10, and arginase-1), detected in the melanoma cells supernatants [80].
Parashar et al. developed capsaicin-hyaluronic acid-loaded PCL-NPs (C/HA-PCL NPs) through a layer-bylayer technique. The C/HA-PCL NPs enhanced the drug release and targetability of the loaded drugs. The
localization of drugs and cytotoxicity of the drugs was significantly improved against the A549 cells. In the

rat model, HA-encapsulated NPs exhibited potential anticancer activity against urethane-induced lung
cancer. The C/HA-PCL NPs significantly disrupted MMP (MMP-2/9), leading to cell proliferation inhibition
and inhibited ROS compared to control groups [81]. Malakpour-Permlid et al. fabricated an artificial 3Dtumor using human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) and JIMT-1 (human breast cancer) cells and within a 3Dmatrix of PCL fibers. It was noticed that the MMP activity was superior HDFs medium than the medium
containing JIMT-1 cells. Moreover, in JIMT-1 cells, treatment of TGF-β1 specifically decreased the MMP
activity; however, it was enhanced in the TGF-β1-treated HDFs medium. Thus, these results could be
beneficial in determining different aspects of tumor progression and the development of targeted anticancer therapy [82].
Molavi et al. developed PEO-b-PCL and PEO-b-poly-α-benzyl carboxylate-PCL (PEO-b-PBC-PCL) based
micellar formulations micelles. They evaluated their ability to enhance the solubility of the loaded drug
(cucurbitacin I and B) and STAT3. The solubility and encapsulation efficiency of both encapsulated moieties
was found to be improved. The conjugated micellar formulations showed significant anticancer by
suppressing the STAT3 levels and inhibiting the cell proliferation in STAT3 overexpressed B16. F10
melanoma cell line in a murine model [83]. Kievit et al. assessed the anti-glioma activities of CURencapsulated PCL nanofibers (CUR-PCL NFs) against the human glioblastoma multiform (GBM) cells. It was
observed that the CUR-PCL NFs significantly promoted the composition drifting of GBM cells through
varying the nanostructure of the nanofibrous membrane. After a treatment of 24 h, the cultured GBM cells
exhibited a noticeable upregulation of invasion-associated genes (STAT3, β-catenin, TGF-β, Snail, and Twist),
signifying a mesenchymal alteration in these invasive cells [84]. Soleimani et al. developed STAT3 inhibitory
agents (S3I-1757 and S3I-201)-loaded PEO-b-PCL- and PEO-b-PBC-PCL based micellar formulations using
co-solvent evaporation method and evaluated their anticancer activity in B16-F10 cells (in vitro) and STAT3mediated hyperactive cancer models (in vivo). The micellar formulations demonstrated higher
encapsulation efficiency sustained drug release profile in physiological mediums. Compared to free drugs,
the micellar formulations inhibited cell growth of B16-F10 melanoma cells in a dose-dependent approach
and simultaneously inhibited the production of VEGF. The nanoformulations led to reduced cytotoxicity of
the S3I-1757 and S3I-201 in healthy bone marrow-derived dendritic cells [85]. Kim et al. developed mPEGb-(polycaprolactone-ran-polylactide) co-polymer and applied them in targeting Stat3-small hairpin RNA as
a gene-based carrier system in anti-tumor therapy. The complex system increased the Stat3 knockdown
efficacy and inhibited the tumor cell growth, with high efficiency and negligible adverse effects [86].
Erdemli et al. encapsulated etanercept into a mPEG-PCL-mPEG polymeric matrix and formed microspheres.
The polymeric matrix improved the entrapment efficiency and drug release behavior. Compared to free
drugs, drug-loaded polymeric microspheres significantly reduced the level of IFNγ, TNFα, IL-6, IL-17, and
MMP-3/13, while conserving the viability of fibroblasts-alike synoviocyte. These PCL-based microspheres
showed potential anti-rheumatoid activity and could also be explored for their anticancer activity based on
the in vitro cytokine results [87]. Balachander et al. developed PCL-based 3D scaffolds and evaluated their
anticancer abilities against MDA-MB-231 cells. The results of relative gene expression studies showed that
the cells grown in the 3D scaffolds exhibited enhanced levels of genes concerned with the three main

metastasis events (instigation, progression, and site-specific colonization). Moreover, results of the
microarray analysis demonstrated that a substantial amount of the genes which got upregulated were due
to the various pro-inflammatory factors, including TNF, NK-kB, interleukins (IL8, IL1α, IL1β), chemokines
(CCL20, CXCL1, CXCL11), VEGFA, and others [88]. Kumar and Srivastava fabricated IR-820 (dye)-incorporated
PCL-glycol chitosan-poloxamer blended NPs (IR-PCL-GC-PNPs) and examined their potential as an imaging
and photo-immunotherapeutic agent. IR-PCL-GC-PNPs improved cytotoxicity against the MCF-7
carcinogenic cells in the existence of laser. It was observed that the IR-PCL-GC-PNPs stimulated TNF-α levels
increased ROS production, leading to reactive DNA fragmentations that caused apoptosis responsible for cell
death. The IR-PCL-GC-PNPs synergistically caused hyperthermia, TNF-α, and membrane disruption [89]. Zi
et al. prepared rosuvastatin-loaded PEG-PCL-nanomicelles (ROS-PEG-PCLNs) for targeting
neuroinflammation (brain edema). ROS-PEG-PCLNs significantly condensed neuron relapse, repressed the
penetration of the inflammatory cell, abridged the brain edema, and enhanced neural discrepancies.
Additionally, it was noticed that the ROS-PEG-PCLNs indorsed the microglia/macrophages polarization to
the M2 phenotype and led to down-regulation of IL-1β and TNF-α expression and up-regulation of IL-10
expression [90].

2.3. PLA-based nanomaterials
PLA is an FDA-approved GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) polymer, frequently used in drug delivery
applications mostly due to high biodegradability and low toxicity, exists in L-/D- form where L-form
exhibits semi-crystallinity while D-form exhibits amorphous behavior. In drug delivery applications, PLAbased nanomaterials provide a hydrophobic center for potential encapsulation of hydrophobic
drugs/bioactive, thus improving the stability and solubility of the encapsulated bioactive/drugs within the
blood circulation [91].
Gu et al. fabricated fibronectin extra domain B (EDB)-mediated peptide (APTEDB)-conjugated PEGpolylactic acid (PLA) NPs, further incorporated with paclitaxel (PTX) for targeting the tumor cells. The
conjugated matrix system entrapment efficiency, payload, and size distribution of PTX. The hybrid NPs
enhanced the cellular accumulation of drugs within the HUVEC, leading to improved PTX-triggered
apoptosis. Moreover, the hybrid NPs significantly enhanced the antiangiogenic abilities of the drug.
Additionally, the hybrid NPs improved the cell internalization and cytotoxicity of the drug against the
U87MG cells. Furthermore, the hybrid NPs elevated the accumulation of PTX within the glioma cells, thus
demonstrating enhanced anti-glioma efficiency [92]. Feng et al. evaluated the therapeutic potentials of PTXincorporated PEG-PLA NPs linked with CooP (tumor homing peptide) formed PTX-PEG/PLA-CooP NPs.
Results of the in vitro anti-proliferation studies demonstrated that the sensitivity of HUVEC cells and
U87MG cells were more the PTX-PEG/PLA-CooP NPs as compared to PTX-CooP-NPs and PTX-NPs. The mice
treated with PTX-PEG/PLA-CooP NPs exhibited the highest survival time compared to other groups with a
prolongation in survival time. Thus, PTX-PEG/PLA-CooP NPs could be efficiently used as a potential
nanocarrier to overcome tumor angiogenesis and treat glioblastoma [93]. Fan et al. developed PLA-PEOPPO-PEO-PLA (PPP) assembled nanofibrous microspheres (NMs) loaded with docetaxel (DT) and curcumin

(CUR), formed PPP-DT/CUR NMs. Drug release from PPP-DT/CUR NMs showed sustained release behavior. It
significantly inhibited colorectal peritoneal carcinomatosis as it effectively induced apoptosis within the
tumor cells and inhibited tumor angiogenesis. Results confirmed the synergistic antitumor effect of the dual
drug-loaded NMs against CT26; hence PPP-DT/CUR NMs could be potentially used in the management of
colorectal cancer (Fig. 7) [94].

Zhang et al. prepared endostar-incorporated PLA NPs conjugated with IRDye 800CW (C-E-P-NPs) to sense
biodistribution in the breast tumor mouse model. Further, the antitumor activity was enhanced by
conjugating C-E-P-NPs with zoledronic acid monohydrate (ZAM), forming C-E-P-Z-NPs. It was noticed that
C-E-P-Z-NPs significantly decreased the viability of HUVEC cells and MDA-MB-231 cells. The results of in
vivo studies showed that C-E-P-Z-NPs exhibited superior antitumor activity compared to free Endostar. The
C-E-P-Z-NPs showed potential synergistic activity as they reduced tumor angiogenesis and accumulation of
tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) in the tumor sites. Moreover, the conjugated NPs significantly
reduced the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2) and − 9 (MMP9). Overall, these conjugated
NPs exhibited potential antitumor effects [95]. Afsharzadeh et al. fabricated galvanic acid-loaded PEG-PLA
NPs (GA-PEG/PLA NPs) and evaluated its therapeutic potentials in the C26 colon carcinoma-induced BALB/c
mice model. The NPs exhibited a size of 140 nm with superior drug release at pH of 5.5 than 7.4. MTT assay
results showed that the IC50 values of NPs (8 µM) were lower than pure GA (15 µM). GA-PEG/PLA NPs
treated mice exhibited reduced toxicity for colon carcinoma. Moreover, GA-PEG/PLA NPs exhibited
antiangiogenic effects and showed lower systemic toxicity [96].
Zhao et al. showed the abilities of a novel DNA-nano complex, comprised of mPEG-PLA NPs and a plasmid
encrypting the matrix protein of vesicular stomatitis virus (MPVSV), for treating ovarian cancer. MPVSV
exhibits a crucial part in the VSV-mediated apoptosis of carcinoma cells. Results showed that
intraperitoneal (i.p.) delivery of the DNA-nanocomplex significantly repressed the intraperitoneal
metastasis in ovarian carcinoma cells with no cytotoxicity. It was conferred that the anticancer effects of the
DNA-nanocomplex were due to induction of apoptosis and anti-angiogenesis towards the ovarian cancer
cells [97]. Jiang et al. developed a complex nanoarchitecture (nanohybrids) comprised of verteporfin, tumor

angiogenesis-directing peptide (iNGR), PLA, D-a-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS), and
chemotherapeutic drug (docetaxel). The obtained nanohybrids were spherical with a mean diameter of
166.0 ± 9.2 nm. In vitro studies showed that in the presence of laser, the nanohybrids demonstrated high cell
uptake, potential cytotoxicity against HUVEC cells, and more efficiently inhibited tube formations. In vivo
results showed that nanohybrids-treated mice showed enhanced angiogenesis, improved accumulation in
drug-resistant HCT-15 tumor cells, and induced apoptosis and necrosis within the tumorous cells [98].
He et al. demonstrated the anticancer potentials of CUR-loaded mPEG-PLA, FA-loaded PEG-PLA, and CURFA-mPEG-PLA nanoparticulate systems against glioma (GL261) cells. It was observed that, as compared to
pure CUR and CUR-mPEG-PLA, CUR-FA-PEG-PLA more effectively suppressed the growth of GL261 cells and
promoted apoptosis. Furthermore, in vivo results showed that the CUR-FA-PEG-PLA treated tumor-induced
mice models exhibited reduced growth in subcutaneous and intracranial regions, probably through antiangiogenesis and enabling apoptosis. Moreover, FA enhanced the anti-glioma activity of CUR synergistically,
and combinedly the nanoparticulate system repressed cellular viability in a time- and concentrationdependent manner [99]. Arora et al. assessed the antitumor abilities of cytokines-loaded PLA microspheres
(MSs) administered to B16 melanomas-induced C57BL6 mice models. Results showed that the cytokine (IL12 and TNF-α)-conjugated MSs exhibited sustained release behavior and induced systemic immune
responses. Moreover, intralesional administration of TNF-α singly or in combined form caused substantial
tumor excision; however, IL-12/TNF-α-treated mice exhibited significant T-cell responses in the splenocytes
[100]. Sabel et al. examined the therapeutic potentials of combinations of intratumorally administered
cytokines (IL-12, IL-18, and TNF-α)-loaded PLA-MSs in generating tumor-specified immune responses and
significant improvements against metastatic breast cancer-induced BALB/c mice model. The PLA-MSs
loaded combinatorial therapy (IL-12, IL-18, and TNF-α) exhibited superior activity in the excision of the
primary tumors, eradicated distant diseases, and enhanced survival of the mice. Moreover, only
combinatorial delivery of IL-12 and TNF-α resulted in enhanced levels of both CD4 + and CD8 + T-cells and
reduced levels of CD4 +CD25 + cells; thus, this approach could be used as potential immunotherapy against
solid tumors [101].
Ding et al. established dacarbazine-encapsulated PLA NPs (DPNPs) conjugated with TNF-related apoptosisinduced ligand (TRAIL)-receptor 2 (DR5) monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to achieve specific targeting against
DR5-overexpressed malignant melanoma cells. DR5 mAb-DPNPs efficiently internalized, enhanced cellular
apoptosis, and exhibited active targeting against the DR5-overexpressed malignant melanoma cells [102].
Zhan et al. reported that a lower amount of PTX significantly improved the gene transfections of the RGD
(peptide)-PEI-PEG-pDNA NPs and, when combined with the PTX-CDX (peptide)-PEG-PLA micelles exhibited
synergistic effects in anti-glioblastoma therapy. Also, the anti-glioma activities of the only RGD-PEIPEG/pORF-hTRAIL (plasmid TRAIL) NPs and combined form with CDX-PEG-PLA micelles were examined
against the glioblastoma-induced mice. Results showed that co-delivery of nanoparticulate systems with
TRAIL and PTX significantly enhanced apoptosis, thus improving the anti-glioblastoma activity [103].
Ding et al. developed DTX-encapsulated PLA-nanofibers (DPNFs) using the electrospinning technique and

evaluated their anticancer potentials against breast cancer relapse. DPNFs-based scaffolds were
biocompatible and caused apoptosis in the treated 4T1 breast cancer cells. DPNFs significantly reduced the
primary relapse tumors in BALB/c mice most compared to other groups [104]. Wang et al. prepared CURloaded mPEG-PLA micelles (CUR-mPEG-PLA Mic) to improve the solubility of CUR and further evaluated its
anti-tumor effects against melanoma. CUR-mPEG-PLA Mic significantly enhanced the solubility of CUR and
showed sustained release in the saline medium. CUR-mPEG-PLA Mic exhibited superior cytotoxicity and
induced the highest rate of apoptosis against the melanoma cell lines B16 (murine) and A375 (human) than
free CUR. Moreover, CUR-mPEG-PLA Mic caused higher apoptosis in the melanoma cells than free CUR and
repressed neovascularization in the tumor tissues [105]. Zhu et al. developed CUR-mPEG-PLA Mic using a
thin-film hydration approach and evaluated their anticancer effects against A549 lung cancer cells. The
cellular uptake of CUR within the A549 cells was significantly augmented. Moreover, CUR-mPEG-PLA Mic
inhibited the cellular proliferation of A549 cells, enhanced the cellular cytotoxicity, triggered G2/M stage
cell detention, indorsed cellular apoptosis, repressed the relocation of A549 cells more apparently than pure
CUR. The anticancer mechanism of CUR-mPEG-PLA Mic was probably associated with the reduction in
expression of VEGF, MMP-2/− 9, and Bcl-2 and an increase in expression of Bax [106]. Chen et al. evaluated
the therapeutic potentials of dual-drug (erlotinib and fedratinib) loaded PEG-PLA NPs (ET/FT-PEG-PLA NPs)
against erlotinib-resistant NSCLC cells. Fedratinib significantly downregulated the level of protein
expressions in the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. The conjugated NPs assisted in the upcoming issues
associated with erlotinib-resistant cancer therapy in NSCLC [107].
Han et al. simultaneously encapsulated both cyclosporin A and gefitinib within PEG-PLA polymeric system
and formed C/G-PP NPs. The co-delivery using C/G-PP NPs with a single administration potentially
improved the suppression rate of tumor growth (NSCLC cells) compared to free drugs, probably by targeting
the STAT3/Bcl-2 signaling pathway. This approach was effective in gefitinib-resistant NSCLC therapy [108].
Ramezani et al. synthesized PEG-b-PLA triblock polymers using PVGLIG (synthetic peptide), specifically
cleaved by the tumor-mediated MMP-2 enzyme and formed nanosized polymersomes. Further, it was
loaded with SN38 (the active metabolite of irinotecan) and conjugated with AS1411 aptamer to achieve the
targeted delivery against C26 cell lines (nucleolin positive). In vitro results showed that the aptamerconjugated polymersomes exhibited higher toxicity against the C26 cell lines than non-conjugated
formulations. In vivo studies showed that aptamer-targeted formulations exhibited the highest therapeutic
index against the mice-induced subcutaneous C26 tumor [109].

2.4. PHA-based nanomaterials
PHAs include a cluster of biodegradable polyesters mostly synthesized from natural sources using
microorganisms under precise synthesis conditions. Among various PHAs, poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB)
has exhibited superior biocompatibility, biodegradability, and manageable thermo-mechanical properties.
PHB and its copolymers are used to fabricate multiple bioactive structures (scaffolds, polymeric film
composites, and others) applicable in diverse biomedical applications, mostly tissue engineering and wound
healing [110].

Lee et al. evaluated the anti-breast cancer activity of poly (3-hydroxybutyrate)-based NPs loaded with a
model drug moiety (the Nile red). These NPs were developed using O/W emulsion-solvent evaporation
approach and were further functionalized enzymatically with a tumor-specific ligand (RGD4C). These
functionalized NPs exhibited improved targeting precisely against the MDA-MB 231 cells only, signifying the
synergistic behavior of RGD4C (Fig. 8) [111]. Kilicay et al. studied the anticancer activities of etoposide (EP)incorporated and FA-conjugated poly (3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate (PHBHH) NPs.
Interestingly, the size of the NPs increased with the increase in polymer/solvent ratio; however, it got
reduced with an increase in the rate of homogenization and surfactant concentration.

The FA-conjugated NPs were more effective against the HeLa cells than non-conjugated NPs. The
therapeutic efficacy and targetability of EP/FA-conjugated PHBHH-NPs were enhanced as they specifically
targeted the carcinogenic cells (HeLa) rather than the normal and healthy fibroblast cells (L929). Moreover,
EP/FA-conjugated PHBHH-NPs exhibited the highest necrosis [112]. Lu et al. developed PHA-based NPs for
sustained release TGX221 (phosphoinositide-3-kinases inhibitor) and evaluated its inhibiting effects against
cancer cell proliferation. It was observed that the growth of the TGX221-PHA NPs treated carcinogenic cells
was reduced as compared to free TGX221-treated or untreated cells. This approach potentially enhanced the
bioavailability and half-life (in vivo) of TGX221, thus improving the anticancer properties against different
cell lines used in the study, including fibroblast (NIH/3T3), human breast cancer (BT-474), human prostate
cancer (PC3) and human large intestine (HCT-116) cell lines [113].
Erdal et al. prepared PHB-coated IONPs via the multi-emulsion method. PHB was synthesized by using
Alcaligenes eutrophus bacteria. To these polymeric IONPs, EP (chemotherapeutic drug) and concanavalin-A
(cancer cells targeting agent) were conjugated. This conjugated system exhibited potential cytotoxicity
against the HeLa cells and was nom-toxic against the L929 cells. This showed that the biogenic polymeric
NPs demonstrated superior targetability and effectively targeted the drug at the targeted sites [127].
Masood et al. explored the applications of Bacillus cereus FB11 isolated poly-(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3hydroxyvalerate) (PHBHV; copolymers of PHA) as drug carriers for cancer therapy. The copolymeric chains
were used to synthesize NPs and utilized for delivering ellipticine. The in vitro studies demonstrated that
drug-loaded PHBHV NPs inhibited A549 lung cancer cells by 2-folds higher than the drug alone. Moreover,
the bioavailability of the drug was significantly improved, and the polymeric NPs exhibited high
biodegradability, biocompatibility, and nontoxic [128]. Pandian et al. demonstrated that L-glutaminase
(marine bacterial enzyme) showed potential anticancer activity as it inhibited the cell proliferation of the
HeLa cells via inducing apoptosis through glutamine deficiency. Further, the stability and bioavailability of
this enzyme were enhanced by immobilizing it over PEG-PHB NPs. Fluorescence imaging and confocal
microscopy results showed that the enzyme-incubated HeLa cells showed dented anatomy. The
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies displayed that the enzyme-treated HeLa cells
demonstrated damaged cytoplasm and shrivelled nuclei. Finally, the effect of enzyme-PEG-PHB NPs over
the DNA of HeLa cells was confirmed using DNA fragmentation and flow cytometry assays [129].
Lu et al. synthesized PEG-PHBHH co-polymers for the effective delivery of rapamycin as a nanoparticulate
system. The drug loaded PNPs were sphere-shaped of mean particle size around 200 nm. The copolymer
coating enhanced the entrapment efficiency and sustained release properties of rapamycin. The cellular

uptake, anti-proliferation effect, and mTOR inhibition abilities were highest in drug-loaded PEG-PHBHH
NPs, studied in PC3 and RAW264.7 cells. The PC3 cells treated with drug-loaded PEG-PHBHH NPs
demonstrated the dramatic inhibitory effect of cell proliferation compared to a free drug at similar
concentrations [130]. Radu et al. developed silymarin-loaded PHBHV NPs to enhance drug solubility and
further target against colon cancer cells (HT-29). The NPs ranged between 100 nm exhibited improved
biodegradability and biocompatibility. The drug-loaded NPs significantly reduced the viability of HT-29
cells, reduced the size of 3D-micro tumors, and enhanced the LDH activity in the culture media. Further, it
was noticed that silymarin-loaded PHBHV NPs showed superior anti-cancer activity than PHBHV NPs [131].
Radu et al. developed 5-FU-encapsulated PHBHV NPs using the emulsification-diffusion technique and
evaluated their anticancer properties for the management of human adenocarcinoma. Further, PVA was
used as a stabilizer and formed 5-FU-PVA-PHBHV. The in vitro results showed that the 5-FU loaded PHBHV
NPs significantly decreased the cellular viability of the human adenocarcinoma cells (HT-29), signifying that
PHBHV itself exhibited low cytotoxicity [132].
Conte et al. synthesized polyethyleneimine-functionalized PHB NPs (PEI-PHB NPs) through aminolysis
reaction and applied it for delivering microRNA-124 against the prostate cancer (PC3) cells. Especially, the
miRNA/PEI-PHB NP complex efficiently protected the miR-124 from getting through RNAse degradation,
resulting in enhanced delivery in the PC3 cells. Moreover, the nanocomplex hindered the factors related to
tumorigenicity, including the proliferation of cells, motility, and colony establishment, due to the
downregulation of CPT1A. Thus, the miRNA based complex PNPs effectively managed prostate cancer as an
efficient and targeted therapy [133].

2.5. Other polyester nanomaterials
PPF is a linear-type unsaturated biodegradable, and biocompatible polyester derived from fumaric acid as a
by-product. PPF exists as a viscid liquid at room temperature, limiting its storage. However, PPF-based
polymeric systems have been reported for wide biomedical applications, mostly in directed drug delivery
systems, tissue and cartilage engineering applications, implant synthesis [134]. PPC is another type of
aliphatic polyester that appears amorphous with excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability
properties; thus, it is widely used in the pharmaceutical and biomedical fields. It is also used to
manufacture biomedical devices, medical sutures, and interlocks [135].
Moraes et al. prepared modified magnetic materials composed of polybutylene succinate (PBS) and
magnetite using the solvent-emulsion evaporation method. The materials exhibited a monoclinic structure
with a particle size of 13 nm. The polymeric materials showed significant anti-cancer activities, tested for
several cancer cell lines, thus could be used in targeting drug moieties for the treatment of cancer types
[136]. Zheng et al. developed spherical-shaped multi-conjugated polymeric micelles composed of paclitaxel
(PTX)-loaded PEG-b-poly (L-lactide-co-2-methyl-2-carboxyl-propylene carbonate (PPC) and FA-loaded PEGb-poly (L-lactide-co-2,2-dihydroxylmethyl-PPC. Compared to individual drug moiety, the multi-composed
polymeric micelles showed higher targetability and anti-cancer activity against mouse models induced with

Lewis lung cancer [137].
Ni et al. fabricated a PPC-based multi-drug (PTX and temozolomide (TMZ)) loaded biodegradable implants
using solvent-emulsion evaporation method, further made into fibers through electrospinning approach.
The fibers showed prolonged drug release with a burst release. These fibers exhibited improved cytotoxicity
against glioma C6 cells synergistically more than individual chemotherapeutic agents [138]. Luo et al.
initially modified PPC into PPC diacrylate (PDA) through acylation and modified mPEG into mPEG acrylate
(mPEG-A). Further, doxorubicin (DOX) was incorporated into these modified-polymeric matrices exhibited
improved biodegradability and biocompatibility. These nanosized complex system-treated tumor-bearing
mice showed enhanced localization of DOX into the tumor cells, triggered under the acidic pH of
endosomes [139].
Choi et al. fabricated poly-propylene fumarate (PPF)-based scaffolds entrapped with DOX-incorporated
manganese oxide and IONPs. The scaffolds were porous and exhibited superior sustained drug release
behavior. The IONPs assisted in monitoring the localization of the drug through magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI). The technique could be potentially used to detect the release behavior and targeting of
chemotherapeutic drugs, thus enhancing the therapeutic efficacy in anticancer therapy [140]. Gowsika and
Nanthini synthesized and characterized co-polyesters, poly [butylene fumarate-co-butylene itaconate]
(PIFB) and evaluated its anticancer potentials against MCF-7 (human breast cancer) cell line. The conjugated
polymeric nanoconstructs exhibited enhanced cytotoxicity against MCF-7 cells [141]. Liu et al. synthesized a
multicomponent polymeric system comprised of hydrophobic PPF–PLGA-PEG and formed and was then
developed into core-shells-NPs through self-assembling and photo-crosslinking methods. The NPs were
tracked by conjugating rhodamine B with PPF/PLGA-PEG copolymers. To this system, FA was conjugated to
attain improved targetability into the tumor microenvironment. The conjugated system was biodegradable,
showed overexpression of FA targets and exhibited potential anticancer antitumor activities with improved
imaging abilities [142].
Lu et al. fabricated dacarbazine (DC)-loaded PPF-mediated microneedle arrays to efficiently deliver the
loaded chemotherapeutic drug transdermally. The viscosity and the mechanical features of PPF played a
crucial role in regulating the drug release, and it was controlled by using diethyl fumarate (DF). DF-PPF/DF
microneedles exhibited a controlled release behavior in treating skin carcinoma. The composition was
found to be biodegradable and non-irritating. The stability of the drug was enhanced, so the therapeutic
efficacy was significantly enhanced [143]. Seetharaman et al. developed mPEG-PPF based micelles for
effective delivery of ibuprofen. The drug-polymer conjugated micellar nanoformulation showed superior
drug encapsulation efficiency and drug payload with the critical micelle concentrations values between 16
and 30 µg/mL. Drug release significantly enhanced with the increase of acidic conditions and was possibly
controlled using specific crosslinking agents. Additionally, these nanomicelles were found to
cytocompatible, internalized at cellular levels, and simultaneously improved the anti-inflammatory
activities of the drug, thus these nanoformulation could be potentially applied in cancer and arthritis
treatment [144].

3. Clinical significance of polyester nanomaterials in cancer therapy
Progression and modernization in nanotechnology have paved a path for the usage of various types of
engineered nanomaterials in the field of drug delivery, targeted therapies, gene therapy, personalized
medications, diagnosis, tissue engineering, biomedical and industrial applications, and other significant
areas. Amongst various nanomaterials, the polymeric nanoparticles (PNPs) have represented as a capable
carrier system due to their superior abilities of covalently binding or incorporating the therapeutic agents
(drugs/bioactive) and exhibiting their targetability with controlled-release behavior in the presence of
various stimuli [25]. In general, the PNPs are majorly categorized based on the origin of polymer: natural,
synthetic, or semi-synthetic [145]. Amongst various synthetic PNPs, the polyester NPs including PLGA, PLA,
PCL, PHA, PPC, and others, have exhibited superior biodegradability, biocompatibility, and
hemocompatibility. Thus, they have been widely used in diverse biomedical applications [146], [147]. Also,
these polyester nanomaterials can be made therapeutically more effective by binding them with numerous
targeting ligands and stimuli-responsive moieties [148], [149]. Inclusively, the pulmonary delivery of
various drug incorporated PNPs has revolutionized the treatment approaches in LC therapy up to a greater
level by overcoming the existing limitations in conventional therapies.
Although polyester NPs-based drug delivery systems have exhibited potential therapeutic and biomedical
applications, their clinical significance in drug delivery vastly depends upon their toxic effects. Various
factors such as low solubility and permeability, accumulations in organs, drug-protein interactions, and
many others are responsible for causing health issues that limit the clinical implications of polyester
nanomaterials in drug delivery. Thus, it becomes necessary to evaluate the short-/long-term efficiency and
safety studies before conducting the pre-clinical or clinical testing in humans. In the case of inhalable NPs,
short-term studies assist in estimating the rapid release or effects of the NPs, whereas long-term studies
assist in determining the consequences that occurred due to partly or completely degraded NPs. In addition,
factors like size, shape, and surface charge of the nanomaterials play a significant role in toxicity, mainly
nephrotoxicity, as these factors are highly responsible for regulating the rate of excretion of the
nanomaterials in urine [150].
In the past few years, several clinical trials and patents have been reported regarding the significant
applications of nanoparticles-mediated delivery systems to effectively manage different cancer types [151].
Abraxane (AX; albumin-stabilized paclitaxel + gemcitabine NPs) was clinically approved by FDA for the
effective treatment of NSCLC, breast cancer (BC), and pancreatic cancer (PC). Furthermore, AX was approved
to treat NSCLC, BC, and PC based on the efficacy in improving cancer patients' overall survival (OS) [152]. In
recent years, several patents have been reported related to the applications of nanocarriers as a potential
therapeutic approach for delivering drugs or bioactive to the targeted carcinogenic sites in LC therapy.
Researchers developed and evaluated the anticancer potentials of antibody-based delivery systems
conjugated with different moieties, including metallic and polymeric nanoparticles. Also, the significant
effect of the ultrasound over the treated carcinogenic cells was noticed. These systems were found apt and

targeted the lung's non-malignant and malignant epithelial cells [153]. In another study, Wu and coworkers detailed the detection of LC cells and targeting of peptide-conjugated liposomal NPs co-loaded
with the chemotherapeutic drug in the effective management of LC [154]. In 2016, Tarasova and the team
developed a protein-based nanocarrier system comprised of drug-encapsulated self-assembling
transmembrane peptides and demonstrated its specific effects in intra-tumoral regions of LC, PC, ovarian
cancer, and others [155]. Perez et al. revealed that the negatively charged (surface) polyacrylic acid-coated
cerium oxide NPs potentially localized within the lysosomes of the LC tumor cells, leading to enhanced
cytotoxicity towards malignant lung cells [156]. Another study by Brenneisen and their team described that
the dextran-coated cerium oxide NPs caused shrinkage of the carcinogenic cells, in which Ce4+ prevailed
Ce3+, leading to enhanced cytotoxic anti-invasive consequences over the squamous tumor cells exhibiting an
acidic interior cell microenvironment [157].
Numerous polymeric NPs are under investigation and trials. Various polyester nanomaterials have exhibited
potential applications for targeting chemotherapeutic drugs in LC therapy; however, a few concerns need to
be considered before translational use. For instance, if the time for clearance of the nanomaterials from the
body is more, then the pre-clinical/clinical studies would extend, significantly increasing the research cost.
Apart from the cost of the experimentations, the expenses of the distinct nanomaterials should also be
considered. Moreover, depending upon the bulk constituents and manufacturing procedures, few
nanomaterials could be very expensive, eventually limiting their usage. Also, detailed in-vivo studies can
significantly demonstrate the nanomaterials' toxic effects and safety profile. Therefore, all these aspects
must be systematically considered before using polyester nanomaterials-based drug delivery systems in
clinical practice.

4. Conclusion and future perspectives
In summary, we have highlighted various molecular and cellular pathways associated factors potentially
inducing acute and chronic inflammation, leading to tumor and cancer. Two major pathways, intrinsic and
extrinsic, significantly correlate inflammation, and cancer. At the juncture of the intrinsic and extrinsic
pathways, key molecular factors include transcription factors (for example, STAT3 and NFκB), cytokines (for
example, interleukins and TNF-α), chemokines growth-regulating factors. Apart from this, the innate
immune cells, including macrophages, NK cells, mast cells, dendritic cells, acquired immune cells (T-/Bcells), and pro-inflammatory factors (IL-1/6/15/17/23, TNF-α, and IFN-γ) play a crucial role in the instigation
of inflammation. The effects of inflammation, particularly in chronic inflammations, the cytokines, and
inflammatory cells may perform as tumor initiators, thus affecting cellular survival, propagation, invasion,
and angiogenesis. A close connection between inflammation and tumor has been noticed; therefore,
targeting inflammation-mediated factors or inflammatory cells plays an important role in enhancing anticancer therapy. Two major mechanisms have been observed for targeting the inflammation-mediated
factors for anti-cancer treatment. Firstly, activation of the anti-cancer immunity cells could potentially
enhance the cancer-killing capability of the immune system; secondly, by inhibiting the pro-cancer immune

cells or altering their polarity towards anti-tumor type by directing the main signaling pathways, which
could effectively hinder the immunosuppressive effects and the progression of carcinogenic cells.
The anti-cancer or anti-tumor therapies for inflammation-mediated cancer usually include the application
of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or immunotherapy; however, conventional chemotherapeutics have
exhibited diverse limitations. Thus, their applications have been restricted in targeting carcinogenic cells. To
overcome these limitations, nanotechnology or nanomedicine have shown immense potential for the
effective management and treatment of cancer types. Various types of nanomaterials have been reported in
cancer therapy, including metallic NPs, vesicular nanocarriers, polymeric nanomaterials, etc. Among these
nanomaterials, polyester-based nano-drug delivery systems have shown immense therapeutic applications
in cancer therapy due to high biodegradability, hemocompatibility, and targetability.
In this review, we have also highlighted the potential applications of various polyester nanomaterials,
including polyester-based NPs systems including, PLGA, PCL, PLA, PHA, and others in targeting
inflammation-mediated signaling pathways and associated factors causing cancer. However, one of the
major complications related to these polyester nanomaterials is toxicity due to various metal catalysts in the
synthesis process. Thus, it is necessary to recognize the probable toxicity effects of these nanomaterials and
comprehensive studies must be directed to establish non-toxic delivery systems in cancer treatment. In this
context, it becomes essential for the researchers to develop modified polyester nanomaterials with the help
of naturally synthesized materials or apply bioactive coatings, which could effectively prevent toxicity and
enhance the drug release properties at specific disease sites. Also, clinical or pre-clinical studies need to be
conducted as they play a crucial role in the efficient translation of nanomaterials-based delivery systems for
achieving patient compliance.

Potential Impact of Oral Inflammations on Cardiac Functions and Atrial Fibrillation
Ghazal Aarabi,1 Renate B. Schnabel,2,3 Guido Heydecke,1 and Udo Seedorf1,*

Abstract
Inflammation may be a risk factor for atrial fibrillation (AF). Oral infections frequently lead to chronic
inflammation, such as gingivitis, periodontitis, and endodontic lesions. In this narrative review, we con‐
sider five basic pathogenic mechanisms that involve oral infections and inflammations in the pathogene‐
sis of AF: (1) low level bacteremia by which oral bacteria enter the blood stream at inflamed sites of the
oral cavity and invade the heart; (2) Systemic inflammation induced by inflammatory mediators, which
are released from the sites of oral inflammation into the blood stream, aﬀecting cardiac remodeling; (3)
autoimmunity against molecular structures expressed in the heart caused by the host immune response
to specific components of oral pathogens; (4) potentially arrhythmic eﬀects mediated by activation of
the autonomous nervous system triggered by oral inflammations; and (5) arrhythmic eﬀects resulting
from specific bacterial toxins that are produced by oral pathogenic bacteria. A number of studies sup‐
port the involvement of all five mechanisms, suggesting a potentially complex contribution of oral in‐
flammations to the pathogenesis of AF.

Potential Impact of Oral Inflammations on Cardiac Functions and Atrial Fibrillation - PMC

2/19/24, 10:54 AM

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common persistent cardiac arrhythmia occurring in clinical practice.
In Europe, around 6 million people suﬀer from AF; in the entire western world 1.5–2% of the popula‐
tion is aﬀected, with more men than women. The prevalence of AF is age-dependent, rising from
<0.5% in 40–50-year-old individuals to 5–15% in 80-year-olds and will continue to increase over the
next 50 years [1,2]. After reaching the age of 40, 25% of men and women are at risk of developing AF
during their later life [3]. Around 70% of aﬀected patients are between 65 and 85 years old [4]. Atrial
fibrillation is a risk factor for heart failure, dementia, and stroke [5,6,7].
Risk factors for AF include age, gender, high body mass index, hypertension, cardiovascular disease,
valvular disease, and heart failure among others [3]. However, these conventional risk factors explain
only a minor fraction of all AF cases, suggesting that additional risk factors may be relevant. Among
these additional risk factors, a substantial heritable component is of note [2]. Large twin studies esti‐
mated the total heritability of AF to be as high as 62% [8] and recent genome-wide association studies
led to the identification of risk variants at over 100 genetic loci [9], many of which located at genes im‐
plicated in heart defects, ion channels, and heart muscle structure and function. In addition to these ge‐
netic markers, there is a contribution of inflammation to AF risk that is likely not suﬃciently covered
by the existing risk models [10]. That inflammation may contribute to AF is supported by a number of
clinical observations: (i) AF is associated with pericarditis [11]; (ii) the incidence of post-operative AF
is influenced by IL-6 genotype and level [12]; and (iii) the observation that 25% to 40% of people de‐
velop AF after cardiac surgery [13]. It could be demonstrated that the time course of AF after cardiac
surgery coincides with the activation of the complement system and the release of pro-inflammatory
cytokines [13,14].
Humans are aﬀected by a great number of infections and chronic inflammations. Over a lifetime, oral
infections are important, because of their longstanding nature and high frequency in the population.
Infective endocarditis, for instance, which is caused by bacteria that colonizes the teeth, often results
from bacteremia after toothbrushing [15]. Participants with high plaque and calculus scores were at a
3.78- and 4.43-fold increased risk of developing bacteremia and bleeding induced by toothbrushing was
associated with an almost eight-fold increased risk for bacteremia [16]. In a recent study, 14 of 22 cases
of pericarditis were positive for endodontitis-related bacteria (63.6%), while eight were positive for pe‐
riodontis-related bacteria (36.4%) [17].
It appears conceivable that cardiac arrhythmias could potentially also be aﬀected by the systemic in‐
flammation, which is known to accompany oral inflammations and/or by autoimmunity against molecu‐
lar structures expressed in the heart caused by the host immune response to specific oral pathogens. Fi‐
nally, arrhythmic eﬀects resulting from activation of the autonomic nervous system and from specific
bacterial toxins that are produced by oral pathogenic bacteria could also play a role. To evaluate these
potential mechanisms, we screened the published literature and reviewed the most important findings in
this context.

2. Frequent Forms of Chronic Oral Infections Potentially Associated with Atrial Fibrillation
Oral infections potentially associated with AF include infections of the teeth, such as caries, which may
lead to endodontic lesions, and infections of the gingival tissues surrounding the teeth, such as gingivi‐
tis and periodontitis, the latter aﬀecting the tooth-supporting structures [18] (see Figure 1 for exam‐
ples). Gingivitis develops when bacteria, which form a biofilm at the tooth surface, infect the surround‐
ing gingiva and trigger an immune response, resulting in swelling, redness and bleeding of the gingiva
[19]. The inflammation can progress to periodontitis, if the bacteria and the accompanying inflamma‐
tion migrate along the root surface and penetrate into the tooth supporting structures [20]. In Europe,
almost 50% of over 30 years old individuals are aﬀected by some form of periodontitis and over 10%
have severe chronic periodontitis [21]. In most populations, 5–20% are aﬀected by severe, generalized
periodontitis [22,23]. Endodontic inflammations result mostly from deep dental caries, when the infec‐
tion penetrates through the teeth’s root canal to the apex of the teeth’s root where a periapical abscess is
formed [24]. Thirty to sixty percent of middle-aged Scandinavians [25,26] and Canadians [27] were
shown to be aﬀected by at least one periapical abscess, suggesting that a large fraction of the population
is exposed to this kind of inflammation.

Figure 1
Oral inflammation aﬀecting the teeth, gingiva, and the periodontium. Shown are examples of a tooth aﬀected by severe
caries, a tooth with abscess formation revealed by orthopantomography, a denture with severe periodontitis with evi‐
dence of extensive loss of attachment and gingival recession at most teeth, and an example of gingivitis with extensive
calculus formation and a swollen and reddened inflamed gingiva.

3. Potential Role of Bacteremia
The oral microbiome, which is composed of more than 700 diﬀerent bacterial species, populate all oral
hard and soft surfaces [19]. To prevent bacteria from entering the body, gingival epithelial cells provide
a mechanical barrier and release antimicrobial peptides (i.e., hBD-2, hBD-3, cathelicidin LL-37). If
bacteria still invade the tissue, immune cells and monocytes, which can release a wide range of pro-in‐
flammatory mediators, are attracted by chemo-attractans, such as interleukins 1 and 8 (IL-1 and IL-8)
[28,29,30,31]. The edematous gingival and periodontal tissues are prone to bleeding, which facilitates
the penetration of oral bacteria into the bloodstream. In addition, the bacteria can enter the body after
internalization, together with phagocytic immune cells [32,33]. Transient bacteremias were demonstrat‐
ed to occur in patients with periodontitis after tooth brushing and following periodontal treatment
[33,34,35]. Oral bacteria and/or their DNA have been detected in human atherosclerotic lesions, the
pericardial fluid, heart valves, and thrombi in many studies [17,36,37,38,39,40]. A recent meta-analysis
of 63 studies that included 1791 patients confirmed the presence of 23 oral bacterial species in athero‐
sclerotic plaques [41]. Campylobacter rectus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontal‐
is, Prevotella intermedia, and Prevotella nigrescens were only detected in cardiac tissue, whereas the
other species showed a more widespread distribution. Bacteria from endodontic lesions, such as Strep‐
tococcus mutans, could be detected in biopsies from heart valves (40% positive) and atheromas (48%
positive) [42]. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) signals for this bacterium were stronger than those
of bacterial species related to periodontitis. Collectively, these results provide convincing evidence for
the ability of a wide range of oral bacteria to invade the body most likely via the blood stream. Howev‐
er, evidence for their presence within the myocardium and their association with the cardiac conduction
system is still lacking.

4. Potential Role of Systemic Inflammation
Higher C-reactive protein (CRP), which is a sensitive biomarker for systemic inflammation, was associ‐
ated with AF in the Cardiovascular Health Study. More individuals in the fourth CRP quartile had AF
than in the first quartile (7.4% vs. 3.7%, adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2
to 2.5; p = 0.002) and baseline CRP level predicted the risk for developing future AF (fourth vs. first
quartile adjusted hazard ratio 1.31, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.58; p = 0.005), indicating that CRP is not only
associated with the presence of AF, but also predicts patients at increased risk for future development
of AF [10].
It is well known that oral infections elevate systemic CRP levels consistently [43,44,45,46,47,48]. The
highest levels have been observed in patients with acute and chronic endodontic lesions (alveolar ab‐
scesses) [49,50]. In addition to CRP, oral inflammation aﬀects the circulating levels of many other in‐
flammatory markers and cytokines (see Table 1 for details) [50,51]. The pro-inflammatory mediator IL6 stimulates the production of CRP and fibrinogen by the liver, resulting in an acute-phase reaction that

Potential Impact of Oral Inflammations on Cardiac Functions and Atrial Fibrillation - PMC

2/19/24, 10:54 AM

has pro-inflammatory and pro-atherogenic eﬀects [46]. Clinical studies have shown that circulating IL6 is not only elevated in patients with periodontitis, but also in patients with heart failure—a major risk
factor for AF (see review by Wollert and Drexler [52]). Interleukin-6 stimulates cardiomyocyte hyper‐
trophy and apoptosis and may contribute to fibrosis during heart failure thereby altering cardiac con‐
duction and contributing to AF. In renal failure patients, elevated circulating IL-6 was identified as a
risk factor for AF [53] and increased circulating IL-6 levels have been demonstrated in coronary heart
disease CHD patients with AF [54]. Circulating IL-6 also correlated with the extent of left ventricular
hypertrophy of the heart, which is an important risk factor for AF, in a large group of 971 patients [55].
Finally, it could be shown that polymorphisms in the promoter of the IL-6 gene, which influence the
concentration of circulating IL-6, were associated with the risk of post-operative AF [12,56]. In conclu‐
sion, the published data suggest that IL-6 may favor AF due to its direct eﬀects on electrophysiological
remodeling of the heart.

In contrast to IL-6, there is little evidence in the literature for a direct eﬀect on cardiac electrophysio‐
logical remodeling for CRP [57]. Although circulating CRP is associated with AF [58], it cannot be
ruled out that it is merely a bystander of cardiac remodeling involved in disease progression. Marott et
al. were able to show that four CRP gene variants, which, in total, were associated with a 63% increase
in circulating CRP, did not contribute to an increase in AF risk [59]. However, elevated CRP may pre‐
dispose patients to persistence of AF via triggering arrhythmogenic foci, which worsen the arrhythmia
over time and lead to worsened outcomes [10]. High CRP could reflect ongoing ventricular remodeling,

as was also suggested previously for acute coronary syndromes, in which high CRP was associated with
worsened mortality and left ventricular dysfunction [60]. The proposed link between inflammation and
AF has potential therapeutic implications, because there are therapeutic strategies available, which tar‐
get systemic inflammation (i.e., statins, canakinumab [61,62]). A recent systematic review of controlled
trials with statins, which included six studies comprising 3557 patients in sinus rhythm, showed that
statins led to a decreased risk of AF compared to controls ((OR) 0.39, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.85, p = 0.02).
Statins appeared to be more eﬀective if used in secondary prevention of AF (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.10 to
1.03, p = 0.06) than in new-onset or postoperative AF (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.37, p = 0.23) [63].
However, it could not be diﬀerentiated to what degree the potential benefit of statin treatment in pa‐
tients with AF were due to lowering low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and inhibiting coronary
artery disease (CAD) progression as opposed to their anti-inflammatory eﬀects. Statins were also
demonstrated to have beneficial eﬀects on the periodontal status in hyperlipidemic patients, which were
interpreted to be due to their anti-inflammatory eﬀects [64,65].

5. Potential Role of Autoimmunity in Atrial Fibrillation
Atrial fibrillation occurring at young age has been observed in several autoantibody-associated dis‐
eases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and antiphospholipid syndrome
[66,67,68]. Among the many self-antigens that have been proposed as potential targets of the self-di‐
rected immune responses to the heart [69], heat shock proteins (HSPs) are of special interest, because
changes in cardiac HSP60/65 expression have been observed in patients with AF [70,71] and auto-reac‐
tivity to HSPs has been observed patients with periodontal disease [72].
Heat shock proteins are ubiquitous molecular chaperones functioning in cellular stress protection,
which are evolutionary highly conserved [73]. Porphyromonas gingivalis and many other bacteria in‐
volved in oral infections, express homologs to human HSPs [74]. The HSP60/65 homolog of Porphy‐
romonas gingivalis (called GroEL) has the ability to induce a humoral and cellular immune response in
humans which is cross-reacting with the endogenous HSPs expressed by the host [75]. An association
between antibodies to HSP60/65 and the occurrence of postoperative AF was reported, suggesting a
potential involvement of HSP60/65 antibodies in the pathogenesis of AF. It was postulated that individ‐
uals with high preoperative levels of HSP60/65 antibodies could develop a harmful autoimmune reac‐
tion under the stressful operative conditions leading to induction of HSP expression and presence of
HSPs on the surface of cardiomyocytes [76], which could subsequently cause myocyte injury and final‐
ly AF.
Activation of the HSP autoimmunity mechanism has been firmly established to operate in patients with
periodontitis infected with Porphyromonas gingivalis [77,78,79,80]. Humoral and cellular immunity
against HSPs is thought to be a normal feature of healthy humans, which participates in the protection
against microbial infections [81]. The ability of the immune system to induce this potentially dangerous

immune response depends on the strength of the HSP60/65 immunoresponse, which is elevated in pa‐
tients with periodontitis. In addition, interaction with highly polymorphic major histocompatibility
complex (MHC) class I and II epitopes on the cells’ surface is required to trigger the response [82].

6. Potential Role of the Autonomic Nervous System
The mechanisms described above link AF to chronic inflammation, leading to a structurally damaged
heart that is prone to developing AF over time. However, AF can also occur spontaneously in people
with a structurally healthy heart, mostly in the form of paroxysmal AF (PAF), which is characterized by
episodes of intermittent AF occurring commonly in younger people. Psychic stress and infections were
among the most common triggering factors of AF episodes identified in a Swedish survey of hospital‐
ized patients with PAF [83]. One of the many responses of the body to an infection is activation of the
autonomic nervous system. An important functional component of this system is the inflammatory re‐
flex, a sensory pathway to detect and localize the presence of inflammation by the body’s autonomic
nervous system [84]. Aﬀerent signals are transmitted from the inflamed tissue (i.e., the atrium) to the
brain via the vagus nerve, which activates the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway by triggering ef‐
ferent vagus nerve signaling leading to secretion of acetylcholine (ACh) locally in the vicinity of
macrophages at the inflamed sites of the tissue [84]. Acetylcholine binds to nicotinic Ach receptors that
are expressed by macrophages and induces macrophage deactivation to limit the release of pro-inflam‐
matory cytokines. In the heart, ACh can additionally activate Ach-sensitive potassium channels, which
shortens the duration of action potentials and the eﬀective refractory period locally at sites where Ach
is released in the atrium, thereby increasing the susceptibility to reentry, which may contribute to in‐
duction and maintenance of AF [85]. The proposed mechanism is illustrated in Figure 2.

Figure 2
Potential role of the autonomous nervous system in the pathophysiology of atrial fibrillation. The cholinergic anti-in‐
flammatory pathway, which is mediated by the parasympathetic nervous system via the vagus nerve, leads to secretion
of acetylcholine, which binds to muscarinic cholinergic receptors. The receptors open potassium channels through
stimulatory G proteins and close funny channels and T-type calcium channels through an inhibitory G protein. This
leads to hyperpolarization, shorter duration of action potentials, a shortened eﬀective refractory period, and a higher
susceptibility to reentry at sites where acetylcholine is released in the atrium. The atria are only sparsely innervated by
the sympathetic nervous system, which may also be activated during inflammation.

2/19/24, 10:54 AM

In addition to the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway, which is a component of the parasympathetic
nervous system, inflammation is also regulated in a complex manner by its antagonist, the sympathetic
nervous system [86]. Its activation leads, among others, to the release of catecholamines, such as nor‐
epinephrine and epinephrine, at the inflamed sites that can be pro- or anti-inflammatory depending on
the cellular and topological context (for details see [86]). States of adrenergic stimulation, such as dur‐
ing exercise, were shown to be triggers of AF in some patients [87] and increased atrial sympathetic
innervations were observed in patients with persistent AF [88]. Moreover, ectopic beats arising from
the pulmonary veins, which are a frequent cause of AF, can be inhibited by ablation of the relevant au‐
tonomic foci, β-adrenergic receptor blockers, sodium channel blockers, and calcium channel blockers
[89].
The heart has an intrinsic autonomic nervous system with autonomic ganglia, which are mainly located
in the epicardial fat near the pulmonary vein-atrial junction and the ligament of Marshall, regions that
are also densely innervated by the body’s autonomic nervous system [90]. This topological situation
might be of relevance for the interaction between the body’s autonomic and intrinsic cardiac systems. It
could be demonstrated that catheter ablation of these regions could improve outcomes in some AF pa‐
tients compared to pulmonary vein isolation alone [91]. Episodes of AF are triggered in some patients
when sympathetic activity is followed by an abrupt change to vagal dominance [92]. An initial increase
in sympathetic tone followed by a marked shift towards vagal dominance was also observed before the
onset of AF in some patients with ectopy arising from the pulmonary veins [93]. Thus, shifting and/or
simultaneous activation of sympathetic and parasympathetic signaling, which is typical during states of
inflammation, may be able to provoke AF in susceptible people.
Severe bacteremia, such as that occurring during sepsis, is a very eﬀective inducer of the autonomic
nervous system and can trigger AF in humans [94,95,96]. However, whether or not the more moderate
forms of bacteremia, which are typically occurring during oral inflammation and dental surgery, can
trigger the autonomic nervous system strongly enough to induce AF is currently unclear. Although, pe‐
riodontitis was an independent predictor of arrhythmic events in patients with AF and arrhythmias oc‐
curred in a very large fraction (93.6%) of hospitalized AF patients with severe periodontitis [97], the
contribution of the autonomic nervous system was not addressed in this study.

7. Potential Role of Bacterial Toxins
Patients aﬀected by oral infections are exposed to many toxins, metabolic products, and proteins of bac‐
terial origin, which may influence the myocardium. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), for instance, which is an
endotoxin that is produced by Gram-negative bacteria, down-regulates the expression of L-type calcium
channels and shortens the eﬀective refractory period in a rat model of AF, which is proposed as a mech‐
anism underlying sepsis-induced AF [98]. Streptolysin O, a streptococcal toxin, was shown to be in‐
volved in cardiomyocyte contractile dysfunction, by impairing the response of cardiac cells to electrical
pacing by inducing influx of calcium into the cytosol through toxin-mediated pores in the plasma mem‐
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6164509/

brane [98]. Results from experiments performed with isolated guinea pig hearts perfused with strep‐
tolysin O were most consistent with a defect in the atrioventricular conduction system and atrial release
of ACh [99].
Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (a Gram-negative, facultative anaerobe bacterium associated
with localized aggressive periodontitis) was recently shown to secrete 179 diﬀerent proteins [100], and
various strains of Porphyromonas gingivalis were shown to secrete up to 250 proteins [101], some of
which may aﬀect cardiac remodeling and induce AF. One of these proteins is P. gingivalis peptidylargi‐
nine deiminase (PPAD), an enzyme involved in protein citrullination. Protein citrullination is a posttranslational modification by which L-arginine is enzymatically converted to L-citrulline [102,103]. Hu‐
mans have five peptidylarginine deiminase (PAD) isoenzymes, which fulfill important physiological
roles during inflammation, apoptosis, embryonic development, and epigenetic gene regulation
[103,104]. Healthy humans are generally immune tolerant to citrullinated proteins. However, since P.
gingivalis PAD citrullinates not only human proteins (i.e., α-enolase and vimentin), but also some of its
own proteins, it was hypothesized that the long-lasting exposure to highly citrullinated bacterial and
host proteins during periodontitis may trigger breakdown of immune tolerance to citrullinated epitopes
in susceptible individuals, thereby favoring autoimmunity and the development of rheumatoid arthritis
[104,105,106,107]. In line with this hypothesis, periodontitis was independently associated with
rheumatoid arthritis in multiple epidemiological studies (reviewed in ref. [108]).
Although Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans has no PAD encoding gene and does not secrete
PAD, changes in citrullination were also observed to occur in infections caused by this periodontal
pathogen, which induced hypercitrullination of a large number of proteins in host neutrophils [109].
The elucidated mechanism involves the pore-forming toxin leukotoxin A (LtxA), which triggers dysreg‐
ulated activation of host PADs and export of the hypercitrullinated proteins from neutrophils, which act
as citrullinated autoantigenes, favoring the formation of anticitrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) and
rheumatoid arthritis. The results suggest that infections with some of the many pathogenic bacteria,
which secrete pore-forming toxins with similar properties as LtxA, may have the more general ability to
induce hypercitrullination and to trigger formation of ACPA in humans.
Hypercitrullination of proteins in cardiomyocytes of the failing heart is likely important, because
rheumatoid arthritis is strongly associated with AF [66]. Anticitrullinated protein antibodies were sig‐
nificantly associated with altered left ventricular structure and function in a recent study on patients
with rheumatoid arthritis [110], and citrullinated proteins with impaired function could be identified in
human myocardial samples from healthy and heart failure patients [111]. However, specific eﬀects that
support an ability of LtxA to trigger AF via citrullination or other mechanisms have not been reported.

The presented findings support that chronic oral inflammations likely aﬀect the pathogenesis of AF by
multiple pathways, suggesting the existence of an oral-heart-axis (schematically illustrated in Figure 3).
Although none of the described mechanisms is specific for oral inflammations, due to the high preva‐
lence and chronic nature of oral inflammations, they may have a profound public health impact. Recent‐
ly, over 100 genetic loci could be identified as functional candidates involved in AF [112]. Among these
genes, a minority, such as IL6, IL19, TGFB1, CARD8, has functions in infection and inflammation,
whereas the majority is likely involved in cardiac and skeletal muscle function and integrity, cardiac
embryonic development, intracellular calcium handling, angiogenesis, and cardiac ion channeling
[112]. Based on the findings described in this review, one might hypothesize that interaction between
the genetic predisposition, which seems to mostly modulate the activity of pathways involved in struc‐
tural and functional cardiac aspects, with chronic inflammation may be crucial for the emergence of the
AF-prone heart.

Figure 3
Potential role of the oral inflammation in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation. Chronic oral inflammation induced by
bacterial biofilm (gingivitis, periodontitis, and apical endodontic lesions) cause a localized inflammation, which aﬀects
cardiac structural and electrophysiological remodeling linked to atrial fibrillation by: (i) low level bacteremia by which
oral bacteria enter the blood stream at inflamed sites of the oral cavity and invade the heart; (ii) systemic inflammation
induced by inflammatory mediators which are released from the sites of oral inflammation into the blood stream, af‐
fecting ventricular remodeling; (iii) autoimmunity against molecular structures expressed in the heart, such as
HSP60/65 and citrullinated cardiac proteins, caused by the host immune response to specific components of oral
pathogens; (iv) arrhythmogenic eﬀects mediated by activation of the autonomic nervous system during inflammation;
(v) eﬀects resulting from specific bacterial proteins and toxins, such Porphyromonas gingivalis PAP and leukotoxin A
(LtxA) that are produced by oral pathogenic bacteria and induce the formation of anticitrullinated protein antibodies
(ACPA). Abbreviations: CRP: C-reactive protein; IL: interleukin; IFN: interferon; MCP: monocyte chemoattractant

Activation of the HSP60 autoimmunity mechanism has been firmly established to operate in patients
with periodontitis infected with Porphyromonas gingivalis. However, although it has been demonstrat‐
ed that the relevant HSPs are induced in the stressed heart, the precise consequences on cardiac out‐
comes and the quantitative relevance of the HSP related autoimmune response have not been suﬃcient‐
ly addressed. Whether the HSPs of endodontic pathogens elicit a similar immune response as was
demonstrated for Porphyromonas gingivalis GroEL, is unknown. The studies concerning the roles of

citrullination and ACPA in the pathogenesis of various forms of heart failure and AF are still at the
very beginning. Thus far, the studies have been restricted to patients with rheumatoid arthritis, which
may be considered to represent an extreme. Since the presence of ACPA in the circulation precedes the
onset of rheumatoid arthritis up to nine years [113], it would be interesting to investigate ACPA in less
extreme cases without rheumatoid arthritis, but with heart failure or AF.
If bacteremia occurring during oral inflammations and dental procedures, such as tooth extractions, can
provide a strong enough stimulus for the autonomic nervous system to trigger AF it should be ad‐
dressed in further clinical studies.
Interesting results have recently led to the identification of a vast number of factors that are secreted by
oral pathogens (secretome). These factors warrant further characterization with respect to their arrhyth‐
mogenic eﬀects.

Abstract
Both anti- and proinflammatory effects of cigarette
smoking have been described. As prostate
inflammation is common, we hypothesized
smoking could contribute to prostate inflammation.
Thus, we evaluated the association of smoking
status with acute and chronic inflammation within
the prostate of men undergoing prostate biopsy.
We retrospectively analyzed 8,190 men ages 50 to
75 years with PSA levels between 2.5 and 10
ng/mL enrolled in the Reduction by Dutasteride of
Prostate Cancer Events study. Smoking status
was self-defined as never, former, or current.

Introduction
Cigarette smoking has been associated with
higher prostate cancer mortality in all comers and
more disease recurrence, metastasis, and cancerspecific mortality after surgery and radiotherapy
for prostate cancer (1–5). Although, the pathways
by which smoking affects prostate carcinogenesis
and prostate cancer progression are largely
unknown, several potential mechanisms have
been proposed, including genetic and epigenetic
changes, enhanced angiogenesis, life style
factors, and inflammation. Indeed, the effects of
cigarette smoking on the immune system are farreaching and may affect the prostate. For
example, there is evidence suggesting cigarette
smoking promotes an overall systemic
inflammatory state by increasing levels of
proinflammatory markers (6). Moreover,
inflammatory changes in distant organs, such as
eyes, arteries, and pancreas, have been described
among active smokers (7–9). Conversely, active
smoking has been linked to a decreased risk of
ulcerative colitis, an inflammatory bowel disease
(10), and rosacea, an inflammatory skin disorder
(11). Thus, the direct inflammatory effects of
cigarette smoking on several organs, including the
prostate, remain to be determined.
Acute and chronic inflammatory infiltrates are
frequently found in the prostate. Previous studies
indicate that between 35% and 100% of prostate
biopsies done for suspected prostate cancer had
some histologic evidence of inflammation (12–15).

However, factors associated with inflammatory
changes in the prostate of men undergoing biopsy
are largely unknown. To date, no studies have
evaluated the association of cigarette smoking
with histologic prostatic inflammation. Therefore,
we sought to evaluate the association of smoking
status and histologic inflammation in the prostates
of men undergoing prostate biopsy in the
REduction by DUtasteride of Prostate Cancer
Events (REDUCE) trial. The REDUCE trial was a
4-year, placebo-controlled study evaluating daily
dutasteride to reduce the risk of biopsy detectable
prostate cancer among patients with negative
baseline prostate biopsy (16). Repeat prostate
biopsies were performed at 2 and 4 years. Thus,
REDUCE uniquely allows the examination of the
relationship between baseline cigarette smoking
and inflammatory changes on baseline-negative
biopsies and subsequent repeat prostate biopsies.
We hypothesize that smoking is associated with
greater risk of inflammation in the prostate.

Materials and Methods
REDUCE design was published previously (16). In
brief, eligible men were ages 50 to 75 years, had
serum PSA ≥2.5 or 3.0 ng/mL according to age
(50–60 and 60–75 years, respectively) but ≤10
ng/mL, one single negative prostate biopsy (6 to
12 cores) within 6 months of enrollment. Men were
excluded if they had history of prostate cancer,
high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia, atypical small
acinar proliferation, prostate volume (PV) >80 mL,
had undergone previous prostate surgery or had
International Prostate Symptom Score ≥25 or ≥20
on alpha-blockers, or were previously on
finasteride or dutasteride. Medical history was
collected at baseline. All men were randomized in
double-blind fashion to receive orally either
dutasteride 0.5 mg or placebo daily and followed
every 6 months for 4 years. To maintain the
blinded nature of the study, PSA levels in the

dutasteride-treated men were doubled (given
dutasteride reduces PSA levels by approximately
half) and randomly adjusted by 0.1 ng/mL so that
the final reported values were equally even and
odd. PV was measured by ultrasonography at the
time of randomization and 2 and 4 years later.
Ten-core transrectal, ultrasound-guided biopsies
were performed as part of the protocol at 2 and 4
years. Baseline biopsies had been performed
before the start of the study (and independently of
the study) and were reread centrally (at Bostwick
Laboratories). Biopsies that were performed as
part of the study were also read centrally. Central
pathology laboratory had no access to the
randomization codes or data on smoking status.
Prostate cancer, acute and chronic prostate
inflammation were coded as present or absent.
Inflammation was also coded based on severity as
mild, moderate and marked according to the
average cell density and extent of tissue
involvement in each biopsy core. Chronic
inflammation consisted mainly of lymphocytes and
variable number of plasma cells and
macrophages. Acute inflammation consisted of
neutrophils. Mild inflammation was defined as
small scattered or patchy aggregates and
presence of nests of inflammatory cells, usually no
more than 10 to 15 cells per nest. Moderate
inflammation was characterized by larger
aggregates and nests, usually more than about 15
cells, invariably multifocal. Moderate inflammation
was noticeable at low magnification. Sheets of
inflammatory cells or extensive multifocal
confluent masses of cells were noted in severe
inflammation, which was obvious and noticeable at
any magnification. Additional criterion for severe
acute inflammation was tissue destruction of any
size (17). Self-reported smoking status was
determined at baseline and categorized in one of
three groups: current, former, or never smoker.
The protocol was approved by the Institutional

Review Board at each research site, and all
participants provided written informed consent. Of
the 8,231 patients enrolled in the REDUCE trial,
we excluded 41 (<1%) due to missing data
including smoking status or histologic
inflammation. This resulted in a study sample of
8,190 (99%) men with centrally reviewed baseline
biopsies and complete data. Positive baseline
biopsies were not included in the study (i.e.,
negative baseline biopsy for prostate cancer was
part of the inclusion criteria in REDUCE).
Moreover, patients were selected for baseline
biopsies based on PSA levels, whereas repeat
biopsies were done regardless of PSA. To
overcome this limitation, we analyzed the 2- and
4-year repeat biopsies given they include both
positive and negative biopsies for prostate cancer.
A total of 6,311 (77%) and 4,619 (56%) had 2- and
4-year per protocol repeat biopsies and were
included in the repeat biopsy analyses. The details
of men who underwent at least one on-study
biopsy have been described previously (18).
Univariable comparisons of baseline
characteristics between current, former, and never
smokers were performed using χ2 for categorical
data and ANOVA for continuous variables. Given
the low numbers of patients with moderate and
marked acute and chronic inflammation,
inflammation was analyzed as present or absent.
The association of smoking status with acute and
chronic inflammation in baseline, 2-, and 4-year
repeat prostate biopsies was evaluated using
logistic regression in univariable analysis.
Multivariable logistic regression models were used
to determine the association between smoking
and prostate inflammation adjusting for baseline
characteristics, such as age (continuous, in years),
race (Caucasian, African American, Asian,
American Hispanic, or other), body mass index
(BMI, continuous and log-transformed, in kg/m2),

digital rectal exam (DRE, coded as normal or
abnormal), PV (continuous and log-transformed, in
cm3), PSA (continuous, in ng/mL) to test the
association of smoking status and baseline
prostate inflammation. The selection of covariates
in multivariable models was based on their
observed and/or previously established
associations with baseline smoking status and/or
inflammation (19). The analysis of smoking and
inflammation at 2- and 4-year biopsies was
adjusted for treatment arm as well. All statistical
analyses were two-tailed and performed using
Stata 11.2 (StataCorp). A P < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.

Results
Baseline patient characteristics
Mean baseline age, BMI, PSA, and PV of our
cohort were 62.8 years, 27.4 kg/m2, 6.1 ng/dL, and
45.7 cm3, respectively. A total of 7,455 (91.0%)
subjects were Caucasian. Abnormal DRE was
identified in 284 (3.9%) patients. A total of 1,233
(15.1%), 3,203 (39.1%), and 3,754 (45.8%) men
were current, former, and never smoker,
respectively. Current smokers were significantly
younger and had smaller prostates than former
and never smokers (all P < 0.05) but had similar
race, DRE, prebiopsy PSA, and treatment arm (all
P > 0.05). Former smokers had significantly higher
BMI than current and never smokers (P < 0.001;
Table 1).

Baseline biopsy
At baseline biopsy where all biopsies were
negative for cancer, acute and chronic
inflammation was detected in 1,261 (15.4%) and
6,352 (77.6%) cases, respectively. A total of 1,196
(14.6%) baseline biopsies showed both acute and
chronic inflammation and 1,773 (21.7%) had no
inflammation (Supplementary Table S1). Acute
prostate inflammation was graded as mild,
moderate, and marked in 1,235 (97.9%), 24
(1.9%), and 2 (0.2%), respectively. Chronic
prostate inflammation was graded as mild,
moderate, and marked in 5,653 (89.0%), 681
(10.7%), and 18 (0.3%), respectively. In
univariable analysis, current smokers were more
likely to have acute inflammation than former (OR,
1.35; P, 0.001) and never smokers (OR, 1.36; P,
0.001) at baseline biopsy. Similarly, in
multivariable analysis, current smokers had

significantly more acute inflammation than former
(OR, 1.29; P, 0.008) and never smokers (OR,
1.30; P, 0.005; Table 2) at baseline. Though there
were trends for current smokers to be more likely
to have chronic inflammation at baseline biopsy on
univariable analysis, this did not reach statistical
significance (Table 2). However, on multivariable
analysis, current smokers were more likely to have
chronic inflammation at baseline biopsy relative to
former (OR, 1.23; P, 0.017) and never smokers
(OR, 1.24; P, 0.014; Table 2). Most of the change
in the OR of chronic inflammation occurred with
the addition of PV to the multivariable models.

Discussion
Cigarette smoking has a major impact on health
issues worldwide. It is the leading cause of
preventable morbidity and mortality in the United
States (20). Several studies suggest many of the
adverse consequences of smoking might be due
to its effects on oxidative stress and immune–
inflammatory system (6). Indeed, cigarette
smoking has been linked to inflammation of
specific organs, such as eyes, arteries, and
pancreas (7–9). However, direct inflammatory
effects of cigarette smoking on urologic organs
including the prostate have not been described.
Therefore, we retrospectively analyzed 8,190 men
ages 50 to 75 years with PSA levels between 2.5
and 10 ng/mL enrolled in the REDUCE study. In
both uni- and multivariable analyses, current
smokers were more likely to have acute prostate
inflammation than former and never smokers.
Results were virtually unchanged in multivariable
analysis and at 2- and 4-year repeat prostate
biopsies. In addition, we found smokers were
more likely to have chronic inflammation in their
baseline biopsies.
To date, no study has examined the link between
cigarette smoking and objectively assessed

prostatic inflammation. In contrast, a few studies
evaluated the association of cigarette smoking
with prostatitis-related symptoms, but with mixed
results. The largest study published by Liang and
colleagues (21) evaluating 12,743 Chinese men
found significant association between active
smoking status and self-reported prostatitis-like
symptoms. In addition, Bartoletti and colleagues
(22) using data from 764 prostatitis cases and 152
controls found significant association between
smoking and symptoms of chronic
prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome. In
opposition, Mi and colleagues (23) investigating
1,242 Chinese men failed to demonstrate any
association between smoking and prostatitis-like
symptoms. Moreover, Wallner and colleagues (24)
studying 703 African American men did not find
any association between self-reported smoking
status and prostatitis. Similarly, Moon and
colleagues (25) examining 184 self-answered
questionnaires filled out by 20 to 49 years-old
subjects failed to identify any correlation between
smoking and urinary symptoms. Thus, it remains
controversial whether smoking has any
association with prostatitis-like symptoms.
However, prostatitis symptoms may not be due to
prostatic inflammation per se but could relate to
bladder issues or even irritants in the urine from
smoking. Indeed, symptoms compatible with
prostatitis are not always accompanied by
histologic inflammation and vice versa (26). As
such, based on current literature, it is not possible
to infer whether cigarette smoking is associated
with histologic prostate inflammation or not. Thus,
our study is the first to evaluate the association
between smoking and prostatic inflammation, and,
importantly, we found current smokers are more
likely to have prostate inflammation than former
and never smokers.
The effects of cigarette smoking on host immunity

including the innate and adaptive immune systems
are far-reaching and occur at local and systemic
levels. Many of the smoking-induced toxic effects,
including the induction of carcinogenesis, result
from direct genetic or epigenetic changes leading
to abnormal gene function. In general, tissue
damage associated with smoking is considered
the main cause for increased numbers of
neutrophils seen in acute inflammation. The
oxidative stress causes elevated concentration of
cytokines which in turn activates
polymorphonuclear neutrophils and prolongs their
survival. Smoking components (particularly
reactive oxygen species) also activate intracellular
signaling cascades generating inflammatory gene
activation (such as production of interleukin-8 and
tumor necrosis factor; ref. 27). However, not all
effects of smoking on host immunity are
stimulatory. There is evidence showing smoking
may impair the function of inflammatory cells. For
example, smoking reduces the ability of
neutrophils and macrophages to respond to
stimuli, phagocytose, kill pathogens, and secrete
cytokines. It also reduces proliferation of T cells
and alters CD4 and CD8 cells (6). Unfortunately,
there are no studies evaluating mechanisms
linking smoking to inflammation specifically in the
prostate. Our findings, however, provide objective
evidence that smoking is linked to changes within
the prostate, suggesting that chemicals within
cigarette smoke may make it to the prostate and
stimulate inflammatory changes. Thus, further
study is required to understand the biology of how
cigarette smoking promotes prostate inflammation.
The clinical implications of histologic prostate
inflammation are not completely defined. However,
there is increasing evidence linking histologic
prostate inflammation with benign prostate
hyperplasia (BPH) and degree of lower urinary
tract symptoms (28, 29). For example, a previous

https://aacrjournals.org/cancerpreventionresearch/article/8/4/312/50454/Smoking-Is-Associated-with-Acute-and-Chronic

2/19/24, 11:07 AM

study using data from the REDUCE trial found
significant correlation between chronic
inflammation and urinary symptoms (17).
Subgroup analysis of the Medical Therapies of
Prostate Symptoms study found men with prostate
inflammation were significantly more likely to
experience worsening symptoms or acute urinary
retention than those without inflammation (30). In
our study, although smoking was significantly
associated with prostate inflammation, smokers
had smaller prostates compared with nonsmokers.
Likewise, previous studies found an inverse
correlation between smoking and BPH (31, 32).
Thus, it seems the effects of smoking in PV and
BPH may be mediated by other mechanisms than
inflammation. Also, there is enough evidence to
support that prostate inflammation is associated
with elevated PSA levels (33–35). In our study,
although smoking was significantly associated with
prostate inflammation, no differences in PSA levels
were seen between smokers and nonsmokers. In

Thus, it remains unclear whether smoking may
affect PSA levels and if it does so by promoting
prostate inflammation. Finally, the role of histologic
prostate inflammation and smoking in prostate
cancer is unknown. Multiple studies have
suggested possible association between
inflammation and clinical prostatitis with prostate
cancer risk (37–40). For instance, several authors
have demonstrated positive correlation between
urogenital infection, prostatitis, and sexually
transmitted disease with prostate cancer (4, 38,
40). Conversely, more recent data suggest

The REDUCE study has many strengths, including
its large international and multicentric population,
per-protocol biopsies regardless of PSA levels,
prospective data acquisition, and central pathology
review. This is crucial in that prostatic inflammation
can lead to PSA elevations resulting in prostate
biopsy. As such, uniform biopsy protocol not driven
by PSA fluctuations is crucial to prevent biases
from inflammatory-driven biopsies. The main
limitation of the present study is that only patients
with PSA values between 2.5 and 10 ng/dL were

acinar proliferation, PV >80 mL, had undergone

Prostate Symptom Score ≥25 or ≥20 on alphablockers were excluded. Thus, all baseline
biopsies were negative for cancer. Although these
exclusions increase the homogeneity of the
sample, they limit the generalizability of our
results. Furthermore, the limited number of nonCaucasian men prevented us from exploring
whether race influenced the association between
smoking and prostatic inflammation. We did not
consider off-protocol biopsies, including
transrectal/transperineal needle biopsies,
transurethral resections, and prostatectomies of
any kind. In addition, patients were followed for 4
years, thus we were unable to study long-term
consequences of smoking on prostate
inflammation nor long-term clinical implications of
prostate inflammation. We did not evaluate

since quitting smoking given the data were not
available. Lastly, smoking status was determined
at baseline only; therefore, we were not able to
analyze changes in smoking status during the
study interval.
In conclusion, among men undergoing prostate
biopsy, current smoking status was independently
associated with inflammatory changes in the
prostate. Although the clinical implications of this
finding were not determined by the present study,
these findings provide an objective evidence that
smoking is linked to changes within the prostate,
suggesting that chemicals within cigarette smoke
may make it to the prostate. This might be a
mechanistic explanation for how smoking may
influence prostatic conditions such as prostatitis or
prostate cancer.

As the most versatile antigen-presenting cells (APCs), dendritic cells (DCs) function as the cardinal
commanders in orchestrating innate and adaptive immunity for either eliciting protective immune
responses against canceration and microbial invasion or maintaining immune homeostasis/tolerance. In
fact, in physiological or pathological conditions, the diversified migratory patterns and exquisite chemotaxis
of DCs, prominently manipulate their biological activities in both secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs) as well
as homeostatic/inflammatory peripheral tissues in vivo. Thus, the inherent mechanisms or regulation
strategies to modulate the directional migration of DCs even could be regarded as the crucial cartographers
of the immune system. Herein, we systemically reviewed the existing mechanistic understandings and
regulation measures of trafficking both endogenous DC subtypes and reinfused DCs vaccines towards either
SLOs or inflammatory foci (including neoplastic lesions, infections, acute/chronic tissue inflammations,
autoimmune diseases and graft sites). Furthermore, we briefly introduced the DCs-participated prophylactic
and therapeutic clinical application against disparate diseases, and also provided insights into the future
clinical immunotherapies development as well as the vaccines design associated with modulating DCs
mobilization modes.

In brief: Manipulating DCs chemotaxis in vivo could be efficacious in either immune responses
amplification or tolerance induction, which may contribute to either prevention and cure against
malignancies/infections or amelioration of autoimmune disorders in clinical. The existing regulation
strategies to modulate DCs migratory ma0.nners mainly include direct regulation of chemokine receptors,
regulation of chemokine concentration in destinations, modulating monocyte precursors infiltration and
DCs differentiation, and physical method-manipulated DCs locomotion.

1. Introduction
Dendritic cells (DCs), the most professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs), are the critical components of
orchestrating innate immunity and adaptive immunity for either immune homeostasis maintenance [1], [2]
or facilitating rapid and robust immune responses against tumorigenesis [3] and viral infections [4]
according to diversified microenvironment cues. Notably, the diversiform DC subpopulations deployed over
the body, the overall amounts and distribution frequency, the positioning and locomotion together with the
biological capacity/maturity of DCs, prominently impact the immunological landscape construction in local
and systematic immune environment as well as subsequent DCs-mediated appropriate elicitation of
immune amplification and tolerance.
Under normal circumstances, to coordinate optimal antigen (Ag)-specific immune responses, peripheral
circulating/patrolling APCs (particularly DCs) usually randomly sample, process and cross present disparate
innocuous or pathogenic Ags in non-inflamed and inflammatory tissues. Subsequently, the Ag-carrying DCs
would be endowed with the competence to enter secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs, i.e. lymph nodes (LNs),
spleens, adenoids, tonsils and Peyer’s patches) via afferent lymphatics/high endothelial venules mainly in a
chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7)-dependent manner [5], [6]. The SLOs-homing DCs function as the “transit
pivots” of Ag-specific adaptive immunity to boost antigenic information intercommunication with resident
DCs, T cells and B cells in differential spatiotemporal localization within SLOs [7], [8]. Therefore, accurate in
vivo chemotaxis and migratory behavior towards SLOs and peripheral tissues serve as the fundamental
prerequisites for DCs to accommodate versatile immunoregulatory efficacy in both protective immune
initiation and tolerance induction [9].
However, multiple diseases featuring hypo-immunoresponsiveness could diminish the local infiltration of
immunoreactive cells, including direct inhibiting immunoresponsive DCs’ de novo development and
aggregate abundance, impairing the immunological capability, and disturbing chemotactic recruitments
(e.g. SLOs-homing instincts and inflamed foci-infiltrating ability) [10], [11]. For instance, the frequency of
blood circulating conventional DCs (cDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) is strikingly depressed in patients
with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, and their migratory responses towards SLOs are crippled
either[12]. Besides, to escape from immune surveillance, in very early phase of canceration, tumor
microenvironment (TME) with immunosuppressive contexture could induce tumor-infiltrating DCs (TIDCs)
dysfunction, and/or almost drastically eliminate competent type 1 DCs (cDC1) with tumor rejection Ags

cross-presentation and natural killer (NK) cells with powerful cytotoxicity [11], [13]. Thus, mobilizing
diseases-reactive DCs to deploy within the lesion regions may be an effective approach to defense from
malignant carcinomas and infections.
On the other hand, inappropriately massive accumulations of inflammatory DCs are the “criminal
chieftains” in persistent and morbigenous inflammation diseases (e.g. local or even general autoimmune
disorders, organic inflammations and graft rejections) [14]. For example, CXCL10 + DCs and their attracted
CXCR3 + effector T cells are gradually deemed as the crucial contributors to immunopathology in several
inflammatory destructions encompassing type 1 diabetes[14], steatohepatitis[15] and lethal
neuropathological syndrome[16].
Consequently, adopting appropriate regulation measures to manipulate chemotaxis in vivo of immune
orchestrator DCs may contribute a lot to acquire optimized immune responses for either provoking immune
activation or inducing regulatory immunity. Nevertheless, insufficient attention has been payed into the
modulating mechanisms and the (clinical) applications of diversified DCs trafficking modes, although the
charming migratory dynamics of DCs indeed potentiate their immunological multifunction. In these
regards, we systemically elaborated current mechanism understandings and manipulating strategies about
regulating directional mobilization towards either SLOs or inflamed focus (including neoplastic lesions,
pathogenic infections, acute/chronic tissue inflammations, autoimmune disorders and graft sites) of
endogenous DC subsets and exogenous DCs-based vaccines. Besides, we briefly reviewed the DCsparticipated prophylactic and therapeutic clinical explorations, and proposed the existing bottlenecks and
potential countermeasures for the future design or development of clinical immunotherapies associated
with regulating DCs chemotaxis manners.

2. Manipulating mechanisms of DCs in vivo migration
As the most professional APCs and the versatile orchestrators of innate and adaptive immunity, DCs are
characterized with multiform inherent peculiarities, including: 1) ingenious endocytic receptor repertoires,
and functional compartments adept at internalized Ag processing and (cross) presenting; 2) disparate
phenotypes and transcriptionally controlled DC subgroups (e.g. cDCs (cDC1 and cDC2), pDCs, monocytederived DCs (mo-DCs), and Langerhans’ cells (LCs))[17], whose patrolling over peripheral tissues constructs
intricate DCs-based sentinel network; 3) dramatic metabolic reprogramming and transition in motility
patterns in response to microenvironmental stimulations[18]; 4) active membrane processes and abundant
cell-cell interactions[7], [19].
Furthermore, spatiotemporal location heavily dictates DCs’ biological function[9]. In fact, whether disparate
immune cell populations are positioning in correct localizations and spatiotemporal organizations
(including homeostatic or inflamed peripheral tissues, focus of infection, tumor lesions and SLOs) indeed
possess profound implications for the amplification and persistence of the optimal immune responses[20].
Generally, tissue-resident and/or circulating DCs would continuously sample environmental suspicious

stimulators or harmless Ags via several methods (including directly capturing as well as Ag transfer)[8], and
the Ag-(cross)presenting DCs could rapidly migrate to SLOs, where they share antigenic information with
SLOs-resident APCs and initiate Ag-reactive T/B cells within specific compartments within SLOs[21]. And
the complicated actin cytoskeleton systems[22], [23] along with diversiform chemotactic signal-chemokine
receptor systems accurately power DCs chemotaxis fashions[24] (Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3).

Fig. 1. Migratory manners of diversified DC subtypes towards LNs and compartments within LNs. All mature
or semi-mature DC subsets could be endowed with the ability to LNs under the guidance of CCL19/CCL21
(mainly produced by stromal cells of LNs)-CCR7 axis via afferent lymphatics or high endothelial venules, for
an amplified immune response or tolerance induction. Ag-carrying cDC1 could enter T cell-localized
medullary zone to initiate Ag-specific CD4 + Th1/Th17 and CD8 + CTLs immunity, and the cDC1-T could
secrete CCL3/4/5 during their intercommunions to attract CCR5 + (CCR9 +) pDCs for a promoted immune
response. The subcapsular sinus (SCS) macrophages could generate CCL1/8 to recruit CCR8 + cDC2 and/or
CCR8 + mo-DCs to activate Th2 and Tfh in T-B boundary. In addition, CXCL12-CXCR4 system and S1P-S1PR
axis also participate in regulate the locomotion modes of LCs and mo-DCs respectively. Mφ: macrophages;

Fig. 3. Migratory patterns of various DC subgroups towards tumor regions. Almost all DC subpopulations
could be recruited into tumor lesions via CCL3/4/5-CCR5 systems, and the chemokines CCL3/4/5 could be
produced by NK cells, cancer cells themselves and stromal cells within TME. In addition, XCR1 + cDC1 are
granted the ability infiltration into cancer regions through the guidance of XCL1/2 secreted by activated NK
cells and/or CTLs, and activated cDC1 further migrate to SLOs to expand CTL populations. Furthermore, NK
cells within TME could manufacture FlT3L to in situ differentiate pre-DCs (especially mononuclear
progenitors) into DCs (particularly cDC1). On the other hand, CCR9 +pDCs are attracted into TME through
chemotactic agent CCL20 secreted by tumor cells, whereas they are tolerogenic and promote immunologic

2.1. Homing to SLOs
When DCs patrolling in peripheral tissues sense danger signals (including pathogen-associated molecular
patterns (PAMPs, microbial components) and danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs)), they are
rapidly activated and traffic to the draining LNs (dLNs). And within these SLOs, they transfer engulfed Ags to
LNs-resident DCs[7] and (corss)present Ags to T cells in paracortex[19] for amplifying protective as well as
detrimental adaptive immune response. Crucially, for a rapid initiation of Ag-responsive immunity, DCs
trafficking to dLNs undergoes a prominent migratory mode shift from a slow and random patrol behavior of
peripheral immature DCs to a faster and directional migration pattern[58].
As a matter of fact, compared to the mechanisms involving mobilizing to intricate inflamed lesions, the
underlying mechanism understandings related to SLOs-homing ability of DCs are relatively clear (Fig. 1),
which mainly encompass various conventional and/or atypical chemokine-chemokine receptor systemmediated migration, as well as other molecules serving as chemoattractants to directly regulate actin
skeleton and/or promote chemokine receptor oligomerization of DCs. Notably, typical chemokines are
classified with the relative position of a conserved cysteine motif, namely, CC, CXC, XC, and CX3C[24].

Remarkably, trafficking patterns of DCs are vary distinctly among diverse DC subpopulations (Table 1)[6],
[59]. For instance, 1) CCL19/CCL21-CCR7 pathway regulates all mature DC subsets LNs homing in varying
degrees[5], [6]; 2) CCL1/CCL8-CCR8 axis affects lymphatic-trafficking cDC2[35] and mo-DCs[38]; 3) CD31,
CD99, C5a receptor (CD88)[60] and CXCL12-CXCR4 engagement devote to LCs’ fascinating journey from
epidermis to lymph system[54], [55]; 4) sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P)-S1P receptor subtypes (S1PR1–5)
mediates chemotactic migration of DCs boosting Th2 immune responses[39], [40] and priming long-lived
memory CD8 + T cell precursors in spleen[56]; 5) CXCL13- CXCR5 axis devotes to Ags-bearing DCs’
emigration to the LNs region where is adjacent to B cell follicles[25]; 6) CXCL9/CXCL10-CXCR3 systems
manipulate pDCs mobilization to infected macrophages residing in the subcapsular sinus (SCS) area in LNs,
upon viral infection[45]; 7) CCL3/CCL4/CCL5-CCR5 axis endows pDCs with the competence to navigate into
XCR1 + cDCs—CD8 + T-cell interaction sites[45]; 8) loss of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) seems to
impair dermal DCs chemotactic responses to CCL19/CCL21 signals[61].
Thereinto, the most important cues to modulate an influx of DCs into LNs are CCL19 and CCL21, secreted
mainly by LNs stromal cells[5]. The concentration gradients of CCL19 and CCL21, essentially contribute to
orchestrate initial accurate cross-talk between DCs and naïve T cells in LN T-cell zones as well as for
stimulating chemokinesis of T-cell within LNs[62]. Interestingly, CCRL1[63], atypical chemokine receptor 4
(ACKR4), could locally scavenges circumambient CCL19 and CCL21 to generate/reshape chemokine
gradients, which engenders CCR7-sufficient DCs to directionally migrate away from the cellular sources of
CCRL1 expression ex vivo and leads to the transition of migrated DCs from the subcapsular sinus (SCS) into
the parenchyma of the LNs in vivo[64]. In addition, CCL21 and CCL19 may respectively polymerize with
CXCL13 to synergistically trigger CCR7 at a relatively lower ligand (or agonist) concentration[65].

2.2. Migration to inflammatory sites
The chemotactic cues that guide DCs entry peripheral homeostatic/inflammatory regions (e.g. virus-induced
pathologic lesions, neoplastic lesions, (vaccine) immunization sites, destructive inflamed tissues, allografts
and autoimmune regions) are quite sophisticated (Table 1), whereas are still inadequate in systematic
researches and summarizations or reviews. In brief, DCs residing in peripheral tissues could not only
participate in capturing and analyzing innocuous and pernicious Ags for further orchestrating Ag-reactive Tcell responses or inducing Ag-specific tolerance in T-B border and T-cell paracortex within SLOs[7], but also
directly regulate T-cell-based immunological activities in situ/in inflammatory foci for maintaining local
immune balance or providing persistent protections[66]. For example, TIDCs are the central force in
initiating and sustaining defensive immunity against malignancies, which could expand and re-stimulate
cytotoxicity T lymphocytes (CTLs) (including reinfused CAR-T vaccines) in tumor regions (mainly in tertiary
lymphoid structures (TLS) [67]within TME) [68], [69]. Actually, CD103 + cDC1 are the main producers of
potent chemoattractant CXCL9, which are necessary for augmenting the efficacy of programmed cell death1 (PD-1) inhibitors and boosting chemotactic recruitment of CXCR3 + T cells into TME[70].
Briefly, it’s indispensable for migration of DCs to a certain target destination in DC-mediated responses,

2/19/24, 11:28 AM

whether in maintenance of tissue tolerance and homeostasis or manipulation of protective immunity to
pathogens and canceration. In consequence, summarizing the unambiguous regulation mechanisms that
control DCs’ directional motility to peripheral tissues, may devote a lot to develop symptomatic treatments
against diseases with hypo-immunoresponsiveness or overwhelming immunoresponsiveness.
Generally, chemotactic and nonchemotactic signals to manipulate inflammatory recruitment of DCs, include
but are not limited to PAMPs (bacterial and viral products, e.g. lipopolysaccharide (LPS)), necrotic cellderived or lesional tissue-released DAMPs (e.g. adenosine triphosphate (ATP)[71], high mobility group
protein B1 (HMGB1)[72]), ectogenous adjuvants (polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly (I:C))[73],
chemokines (e.g. chemerin[51], [52], [74], XCL1[15], CCL20[41]), proinflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-25),
bioactive lipid molecules, formyl peptides (or their analogs) [43], antimicrobial proteins (e.g. eosinophilderived neurotoxin (EDN)[75]) and complement fragments (e.g. complement protein C1q[76]), which
function both individually and in concert by forming an intricate chemotaxis regulatory meshwork[24].

2.2.1. Gastrointestinal tract
During pathogenic bacteria attack gastrointestinal tract (Fig. 2), inflammatory CX3CR1 + DCs emigrate to
infected sites under the guidance of CX3CL1 secreted by intestinal epithelial and endothelial cells. Then,
CX3CR1 + DCs preferentially support Th1/Th17 CD4 + T cell and CD8 + effector T cell differentiation to boosts
protective immunity against potentially pathogens[29], [33].
On the other hand, establishing immune tolerance to harmless dietary protein-Ags and commensal bacteria
is indispensable for maintenance of organism homeostasis. Therefore, to prevent food allergies and
inflammatory bowel disease (even colorectal cancer), migratory CD103 + DCs and CCR9 + pDCs induce
lymphatic tolerance to harmless non-self commensal bacteria and food-Ag with the Ag-transfer behavior
with gut-resident CX3CR1 + macrophages by IL-10-medited regulatory T cells (Treg) differentiation,
although how to recruit such migratory CD103 + DCs still remains largely unexplored [29], [30], [48], [50],
[77].

2.2.2. Infection sites
An efficacious immune response against viral or bacterial infection must control pathogen dissemination in
vivo without inducing immunopathology. Considering that DCs play a critical role in coordinating both
innate and adaptive immune responses to pathogen infection, appeal for a highly deployed and manoeuvred
microbial-engendered DCs responses to balance an appropriate anti-infection response and slight
immunopathology inducement. During causative agent-provoked infections, CCR6 is generally thought to
be the important receptor responsible for trafficking of peripheral patrol DC subsets to the infected tissues
in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli during viral/bacterial entry. In detail, peripheral circulating or
certain tissue-resident DC subpopulations (including cDCs, pDCs and mo-DCs) could directionally migrate to
infected sites in a CCL20-CCR6-based mechanism, and subsequently elicit a synergistic humoral and/or
cellular immunity in infected tissues (e.g. lung and SI) [37], [41], [42], [46]. Besides, CCL20/CCL27/CCL28https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332223002457?via%3Dihub

Page 13 of 106

2/19/24, 11:28 AM

CCR10 and CXCL12/CXCL9/CXCL10-CXCR3 pathways endow pDCs with the capacity to migrate peripheral
sites of inflammation/infection as well[45], [46], [53]. In addition, CCR5 + DCs could rapidly race to invading
mycobacterial region and generate effector immune responses in response to constitutively overexpressed
heat shock protein (myHsp70) from mycobacterium[26].

2.2.3. Tumor sites
Tumors are unique in comparison to other tissues for their suppression to immunoresponsive immunity.
Furthermore, both of DCs accumulating into immunosuppressive tumor regions as well as detecting tumor
cells (that could act as library with abundant antigenic information) in a complex maze-like TME, are
heavily dependent on the pinpoint navigation mediated by the intensity of chemical gradients and the
degree of spatial confinement (Fig. 3), during tumorigenesis and cancer progression[78]. However, the
underlying mechanistic details of immature DCs’ migratory behavior in and/or towards TME still remains
much unexplored and needs to be further defined.
XCL1 (and XCL2, a paralog of XCL1 found in humans), also known as lymphotactin, which is mainly
produced by NK cells[11] as well as activated CD8 + T cells[79], is one of the most significant chemotactic
factors for attracting Ag-cross-presenting XCR1 + cDC1. It seems that the lymphotactin even could induce
more robust DCs-dependent CD8 + effector and memory T-cell stimulation in comparison to poly(I:C)
commonly utilized in clinical research[80]. Besides, the expression of CCR5 in DCs is also regards as a
significant biomarker in their potential chemotaxis to intratumoral area[11], [27]. And pathological
diagnosis results from several patients with melanoma suggested that CCL20 could guide circulating CCR6 +
pDCs entry into melanoma primary lesions[47]. In addition, after tumor cells undergo immunogenic cell
death (ICD), annexin A1 (ANXA1), a ubiquitously expressed cytosolic protein, is massively released into
TME. Then, ANXA1 could facilitate DCs expressing protein formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1) positioning to
the most proximal Casp3a+ (dying) cancer cells, capturing Ag fragments of dying tumor cells and in situ
(re)activating neighboring tumor-killing T cells[28].
On the other hand, to excluded TIDCs in the early tumor stages, “tricky” tumor always down-regulates
several chemotactic cues significant for DCs’ chemotaxis towards tumor region. For examples, for immune
evasion, invasive carcinoma types (e.g. mammary cancer[81], melanoma[82] and hepatocellular
carcinoma[83]) always decease production and section of chemerin[74] to escape from immune tracking of
chemokine-like receptor 1 + (CMKLR1) DCs and NK cells, which can serve as an independent risk factor for
survival[84]. Further, to diminish the abundance of tumor-residing DCs, not only tumor itself can whittle
down the emission of DCs-recruiting chemoattractants (such as CCL4 and CCL5[85]), but also can prevent
immunoreactive or chemokines-producing cells from providing guidance cues (such as CCL5, FMS-like
tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt3L) and XCL1) for peripheral DCs [11].

2.2.4. Autoimmune disease sites and tissue inflammation
Inflamed endothelial cells and fibroblasts in autoimmune diseases (i.e. lupus erythematosus, psoriasis, and
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332223002457?via%3Dihub

2/19/24, 11:28 AM

rheumatoid arthritis) and in other inflammatory sites could express chemoattractant chemerin, to attract
ChemR23-expressing DCs (especially pDCs) and NK, which locally promotes activation and expansion of
pathogenetic T cells[51], [52], [86]. What’s more, Fcγ receptors (FcγRs) engagement by IgG immune
complexes further induces autoantigen-bearing DCs homing to the T-cell paracortex of dLNs, which may
worsen or increase the burden of autoimmune diseases. during autoimmune disease sites[87]. Moreover,
CX3CR1 directs CD103 + /CD11b+ DCs positioning to pancreatic islets, where DCs reactivate and interact
with islet-infiltrating autoreactive T cells, which is deemed as a contributor to immunopathology in type 1
diabetes[33]. Beside, in the sensitization phase in cutaneous immunity, dermal macrophages initiate the
formation of DC clusters through producing CXCL2[34]. Further, after generated from splenic inflammatory
monocytes, CCR5 +CXCL9 +CXCL10 + mo-DCs enter central nervous system (CNS) during cerebral malaria
and boost the influx of CXCR3 +CD8 + CTLs, provoking a lethal neuropathological syndrome[16]. XCR1 +cDC1
are a pivotal regulator of pathogenesis in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), whose large-scale entry into
liver may greatly foster liver inflammation and injury in NASH[15]. CCR4 + cDCs could respond to the
chemotactic recruitment of CCL17/CCL22 secreted by intracephalic cDCs themselves, and subsequently
migrate into CNS, leading to Th17-based development/deterioration of experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis[31]. Interestingly, thymic tolerogenic DCs also feature XCR1 and respond to the
chemoattraction to XCL1 as well, whose predominant accumulation in the medulla devotes to establish
central tolerance[1]. Besides, the lack of XCR1 + tolerogenic DCs may cause the development and
progression of autoreactive diseases, such as spondyloarthritis[2].
Hence, to relieve the burden of autoimmune disorders and local harmful inflammation, there are two main
strategies, including 1) increasing tolerogenic DCs SLOs- or thymus-homing to expand immunosuppressive
Treg subpopulation, and 2) directly restricting biological function of autoreactive or inflammatory DCs via
immunologic or migratory suppression drugs. For example, Regmi et al. prepared a FK506-loaded ROSresponsive microsphere, whose oral administration could inhibit colonic DCs’ LNs-homing and
corresponding accumulation of colon-reactive Th1/Th17 in inflamed foci to ultimately alleviate
inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD)[88].

2.2.5. Allergic locus
Similar to autoimmune diseases, allergy, is featured with persistent chronic/acute local/systemic
inflammation responses and hypersensitivity to exposed typically harmless Ags. For instance, when
exposed to innocuous house dust mite (HDM), airway epithelial cells could generate massive DAMPs,
chemokines and cytokines to promote the inflammatory infiltration of monocytes and invariant natural
killer T (iNKT) cells, and the latter could further produce chemotactic cue XCL1 to grant XCR1 + CD103 + DCs
entry into the lung. Then, the accumulation of activated XCR1 + DCs favors the development of pulmonarybased allergic asthma ultimately[32]. In addition, CCL2-CCR2, CRAMP-Fpr2, and CCL20-CCR6 participate in
sequential trafficking of mo-DCs and pDCs from the circulation to the inflammatory lung, leading to allergic
airway inflammation and acute asthma exacerbations[42], [43], [44].

2/19/24, 11:28 AM

What’ more, CCR9 + pDCs seems to devote a lot to damp allergic reactions by inducing Treg initiation[49],
[89], [90]. Besides, given that the expression of ectonucleotidases CD39 is evidently impaired in the
anaphylactic foci, administration of apyrase, whose enzymatic activity essentially identical to CD39, could
decrease the chemotactic migration of hypersensitive DCs and accordingly relieve allergic airway
inflammation[91].

2.2.6. Allografts
Since introducing organ transplantation into medical practice, improvement and expectation have been
accumulated, though establishment of hosts’ long-term immune tolerance (>5-year) to alloantigen is still a
main unsolved target in clinical transplantation. In fact, the rapid acquisition of graft organ’s antigenic
information by host APCs often provokes severe (even destructive) immune rejection and allograft necrosis
through host’s DCs-mediated autoreactive T-cell proliferation[7] and diversiform T-cell differentiation
(especially CD8 + effector T-lymphocyte and memory T-lymphocyte subpopulations[92]). In clinical practice,
the upregulation of CCR5 on CD16 + myeloid blood DCs in allogeneic hemopoietic cell graft patients could be
intertwined with the development of moderate to severe graft versus host disease (GvHD), and the
detection of amplified CCR5 + CD11c+ CD16 + DCs subtype in patients’ peripheral blood may enable preemptive therapeutic intervention prior to the clinical diagnosis of GvHD[57]. Interestingly, to avoid graft
rejection during allograft postoperation, Fiorina and colleagues pre-cultured langerhans' islets with CCL21
(the ligand for CCR7) before transplantation, to enhance the efflux of donor’s DCs from islet preparations
and accordingly restrain donor’s DCs rapid migration to recipient’s LNs after transplant surgery, which
prominently prolongs islet allotransplantation survival[93].
Some evidence demonstrates that alloantigen-specific unresponsiveness and a long-term graft survival
happen when CCR2 + pDCs migrate to graft site in response to the guidance of CCL2 produced by the graft
and then alloantigen-carrying CCR2 +CCR7 + pDCs home to LNs where the “tolerance-executors” (Treg)
differentiate[94]. Analogously, CCR2 + pDCs and cDCs contribute to the establishment of central tolerance
for avoiding autoimmune responses, with the chemotactic recruitment of CCL2 secreted by mTECs in
thymus[36]. Therefore, adoptive transfer of alloantigen-carrying CCR2 +CCR7 + pDCs may become an
efficacious strategy to prevent lethal local inflammation or transplantation necrosis[94]. Moreover, it seems
that volunteer donors’ pDCs are the significant pathogenesis of GvHD after allogeneic hematopoietic stem
cell transplantation, but the donors’ pDCs with secretory function of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)
could migrate to multiple organs (including spleen, lung, colon and small intestine) of recipients, and
engender immune tolerance[95].

3. Regulation strategies to manipulate DCs migration
In general, the principle and the foremost quest of applying diversified regulation strategies to modulate
DCs in vivo chemotaxis, is preserving the immune homeostasis and rebuilding immune balance in host, no
matter the host is challenged with immune-deficiency disorders (e.g. pathogenic infections and malignant
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332223002457?via%3Dihub

2/19/24, 11:28 AM

carcinomas) or immune- hypersensitivity diseases (e.g. allergy, autoimmunity and tissue inflammation). 1)
Therefore, when facing malignancy invasion and pathogenic viral/bacterial attack, it’s of necessity to boost
Ag-reactive immune responses for rapidly eliminating mutational or infected cells as well as pernicious
pathogens. Potentiating competent DCs’ capacity to accumulate in the lesions (neoplasm and/or infection)
for amplified cross presentation of microbial/tumor Ag epitopes, and/or boosting mature DCs’ SLOs-homing
talent for improved antigenic information-based cell-cell crosstalk and coordinated activation, may
contribute to enlarge activated Ag-specific T-cell subpopulations-mediated systemic immune responses. 2)
Moreover, after vaccine-mediated local immunization, mobilizing DCs’ and mononuclear progenitors’ entry
into injection sites could facilitate maturation and SLOs-homing of vaccinal Ag-carrying DCs, which may
significantly magnify the strength and duration of vaccine-induced immune response. 3) On the other hand,
when the hosts are faced with immune-overreaction-mediated destructive conditions, either inhibiting the
assemblage of inflammatory DC subgroups (pDCs, cDCs, mo-DCs and monocyte precursor cells) or
heightening the infiltration of heterogeneous tolDCs in the region suffering from pathologic inflammation,
may ease the burden of pathological progress to a certain degree.
Furthermore, cancer, which features the increased incidence and high lethality, can structure an intricate
and immunosuppressive meshwork composed of heterogeneous immunoregulatory components for
constant immune privilege. Additionally, the captivating immune contexture within TME profound impacts
clinical outcomes of diversified immunization therapies. Besides, given that DCs act as the cardinal
orchestrators or commanders both in innate and adaptive immune responses, the increased
intratumoral/peritumoral amount of DCs benefit to both mobilize tumor associated Ags/tumor-specific Ags
(TAAs/TSAs)-specific CTLs-mediated tumor suppression and augment the immunoresponsiveness of various
immunotherapies in clinical. Moreover, considering the restrained length of this review and the universal or
analogous property of regulation measures in diverse types of diseases as mentioned above, we herein
mainly took cancers for instance to elaborate the modulation strategies in manipulating migration of
endogenous DCs and exogenous DCs vaccines for amplified anti-tumor immunity.
Generally, regulation strategies of controlling DCs chemotaxis are composed of 1) direct regulation of
chemokine receptors, 2) regulation of chemokine concentration in destinations, 3) modulating monocyte
precursors infiltration and DCs differentiation, and 4) physical method-manipulated DCs locomotion. And
the specific approaches have been described in Table 2, Table 3 and Fig. 4 respectively.

chemotherapy; RT: radiotherapy.

3.1. Direct regulation of chemokine receptors of DCs
On the one hand, canceration regions could restrict the entry of DCs by both direct downregulation of the
expression of chemokine receptors associated with tumor-infiltration competence in DCs and hampering
the interaction-modulated synergetic recruitment of DCs with other immunoreactive and
immunoresponsive cells (especially NK). For example, tumor-derived liver X-α receptor (LXRα) agonists
could restrict CCR7 expression on activated DCs and correspondingly dampen the expansion of anti-tumor
effector T cell populations in SLOs[96]. On the other hand, the immunosuppressive TME can convert tumorinfiltrating DCs into dysfunctional or immature phenotypes, leading to hindered migration capability of
endogenous DCs or DC vaccines to LNs where they share antigenic information and cross prime T cells[97].
Accordingly, 1) directly upregulating chemokine receptors that endow DCs with the potentiality to migrate
into neoplastic lesions, and/or 2) boosting the maturation along with maintaining the immunological
competence of intratumoral TAAs/TSAs-crosspresenting DCs to foster DCs locomotion to tumor dLNs
(TdLNs) or TLS (the intratumoral/peritumoral tertiary lymphoid structures similar to secondary follicles in
LNs)[67], may both be considerable attempts to ameliorate DCs-based anti-tumor immunity (Table 2, Fig.
4A).

3.1.1. Administration of "danger signals"
Subunit vaccines, recombinant protein and/or polysaccharide subunit vaccines particularly, always suffer
from its low immunogenicity and insufficient cross presentation by DCs after administration in a high dose.
Such immunological hypo-responsiveness usually leads to Treg-mediated tolerance induction and restricts
CTLs-mediated cellular immunity and antibodies-based humoral immunity in vivo[122]. As a matter of fact,
using Ags alone without combining any other immunogenic molecules to pulse in vitro-derived autologous
DCs could yield regulatory DCs, whose adoptive transfer could sculpture Ag-specific immunomodulation
through amplification of tolerogenic Treg population in vivo and accordingly may enable robust and
prolonged protection against autoimmune destruction in clinical researches and pre-clinical studies for
autoimmune disorders[123].
In this connection, to amplify immune responses in vaccine immunization or anti-tumor treatment,
adjuvants, the analogues of "danger signals" (or pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) /
damaged cell-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs)) with prominent immunomodulatory effect, are
significant vaccine components to amplify the breadth, magnitude and durability of vaccines-mediated
immunological capacity[19].
Although currently we are into a new age for human vaccine adjuvants[124], underlying mechanisms about
how FDA-approved adjuvants contained in vaccines on the market actually function still keeps
incomprehension. In fact, PAMPs, the conserved motifs in microorganisms’ components or danger signals,
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332223002457?via%3Dihub

2/19/24, 11:28 AM

along with DAMPs released by damaged cells or tissues[125] are endogenous adjuvants, which could be
recognized by all DC subtypes through multifarious pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) on or within DCs.
In detail, PRRs could be divided into several main types, including toll-like receptors (TLRs), C-type lectin
receptors (CLRs), nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs), retinoic acidinducible gene (RIG)-like helicases (RLHs) and recently identified stimulator of interferon genes (STING)
proteins[126], [127], [128], [129]. Additionally, once PRRs are stimulated by different environmental "danger
signals", these activated distinct PRRs could prominently modulate activation modes of DCs and subsequent
DCs-based differentiation modes of T cells to varying degrees, inducing amplification and/or tolerance in
cellular immunity and humoral immunity[130].
3.1.1.1. Adjuvant administration
In brief, appropriately administrating adjuvant components may ameliorate the maturity of DCs,
hallmarked with a prominent upregulation of LN-homing chemotactic factor receptors as well as costimulatory molecules, and polish up the intensity and persistence of Ag-reactive immunity. For example,
Carson and colleagues endowed DCs with fostered capacity to enter T cell paracortex of LNs and stimulate
tumor-killing CTLs by coupling the model Ag OVA with double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) analogue poly (I:C),
which potently augmented mature DCs-based anti-tumor cellular immunity[73]. Zhuang et al. co-delivered
MHC I- and MHC II-restricted antigenic peptides and TLR4 agonist monophosphoryl lipid A by lipidenveloped zinc phosphate hybrid nanoparticles to irritate DCs maturation and multiple T-cell-priming
cytokines secretion, boosting robust effectiveness on tumor prevention and therapy[98]. Liu et al. designed
a dual-sensitive dendrimer cluster-based nanoadjuvant to delivering CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (CpGODNs) into TIDCs, facilitating the maturation and activation of TIDCs[99]. Beside, Nguyen et al. yielded a
multipurpose nano-system coupling nanovaccines (pre-loading both OVA and TLR9 agonist CpG-ODNs) and
the DC-recruiting macroporous scaffold containing granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GMCSF), which inspired recruitment of immature DCs in injection sites and LNs-homing of mature DCs[100].
Importantly, nucleic acid-based vaccines, which provide a promising platform for prophylactic and
therapeutic vaccines development in anti-cancer and anti-viral immunotherapies, possess a powerful selfadjuvant effect that could directly serve as PAMPs and interact with PRRs (such as TLR3/7/8/9) of DCs. That’s
to say, under normal circumstances nucleic acid-based vaccines are adequate in immunogenicity compared
with simple protein or polysaccharide subunit vaccines mentioned above[102], [131]. For example, Thanh et
al. created a DNA vaccine mixed with chemoattractant GM-CSF-loaded injectable mesoporous silica
microrods (MSRs), which provoked a robust immunological activity of DCs and initiated effective Agspecific Th1 immune response[101]. Moreover, Kowalczyk et al. intradermally delivered a protamine mRNA
vaccine, which massively activated migratory DCs and induced Ag-specific immune response[102]. Van Lint
and colleagues intratumorally injected TAA and an mRNA-based adjuvant, which comprised of three mRNA
molecules encoding costimulatory molecule CD70, constitutively active TLR4 and activation stimulator
CD40 ligand (CD40L), which reprogrammed malfunctioned TIDCs into functional types in various murine
cancer models[103].

3.1.1.2. DAMPs inducer administration
Moreover, considering that immunologic adjuvants applied in clinical and laboratory are essentially
exogenous "danger signals", administrating inducers of "danger signals" to directly generate and release
endogenic DCs-stimulating molecules (mainly DAMPs) could also theoretically manipulate chemokine
receptors-mediated emigration behavior in DCs. Actually, DAPMs will be exposed or released within
inflammatory tissues by stressed, damaged, dying, or apoptotic cells, after the local tissues or cells are under
laser, hypoxia, redox imbalance, acidosis, hypertonic/hypotonic stress and intracellular ion or cytoskeleton
perturbations[132].
Accordingly, felicitously utilizing inducers of DAMPs would be an available attempt to in situ recruit,
stimulate and activate DCs as well as increase SLOs-homing capacity. Schineis et al. co-encapsulated a
photosensitizer together with Ags in PLGA microspheres to promote photochemical internalization (PCI)mediated Ag cross presentation and CCR7-based LNs chemotaxis in DCs, which may be a promising strategy
for therapeutic cancer vaccinations, though PCI-based PLGA microspheres-immunization indeed provoked a
transient skin inflammation[104]. Similarly, Machado et al. implied that combining epicutaneous
immunization via laser microporation with DCs-targeting mannan neoglycoconjugates could synergistically
elicit preferential humoral and cellular immune responses compared with intradermal vaccine
inoculation[105].
Specially, the DAMPs and TAAs/TSAs during tumor therapy, such as γ-irradiation-based radiotherapy (RT)
[133], [134], chemotherapy (CT) (e.g. anthracyclines and oxaliplatin)[135], photosensitizer-and lasermediated photo-thermotherapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT)[136], are massively released due to
ICD of tumor cells. Importantly, most of the first-line treatments for cancer patients are CT or RT, which
stand a good chance to become valuable ICD inducers to trigger tumor immunogenicity in clinical. Actually,
the DAMPs featuring main immunogenic characteristics of ICD, include adenosine triphosphate (ATP),
surface-exposed calreticulin (CRT), heat shock protein (Hsp70 and Hsp90), ANXA1, high mobility group
protein B1 (HMGB1), soluble F-actin as well as micronuclei and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which
intercommunicate with purinergic receptor, phagocytic receptor, FPR1, TLR4, C-type lectin domain
containing 9 A (CLEC9A)[137] and endosomal TLR3[138] respectively, leading to a cascaded process
composed of recruitment, mature and LNs-migration of DCs[139].
For instance, Ghiringhelli et al. employed tumoricidal activity of oxaliplatin to foster the release of ATP from
EL4 thymomas cells, and released ATP could function on P2X7 purinergic receptors in neighboring DCs and
subsequently triggered pyrin domain containing-3 protein (NLRP3) (belonging to NLR family)
inflammasome activation-dependent DCs maturation[106]. Lu et al. utilized tumor cell or their intracellular
substances to co-culture with ex vivo-generated mo-DCs, which endowed these mo-DCs with accomplished
capacity to identify intricate TME and locomote towards tumors in vivo and in vitro[27]. Pfirschke et al.
combined clinically approved chemotherapeutic drugs (oxaliplatin and cyclophosphamide) to engender ICD
in Kras/Trp53 mutant lung tumor models, which activated intratumoral/peritumoral DCs via a TLR4stimulated manner and subsequently made resistant tumors sensitive to ICB immunotherapies due to the

2/19/24, 11:28 AM

mature DCs-based CTLs influx[107].

3.1.2. Gene engineering
As mentioned above, migratory dynamics of DCs towards inflammatory locus or SLOs are exquisitely and
elaborately modulated by the coordination of paired chemotactic cues in destination and corresponding
chemokine receptors on DCs. However, considering that 1) ex vivo-derived mo-DCs vaccines may exhibit
inherent deficiencies in immune activation characteristics compared with naturally in vivo-developed DCs
(mainly refers to cDCs), such as suboptimal CCR7 expression and inferior IL-12 and interferon (IFN) I/III
secretion, leading to defective LNs homing competence (including intradermal (i.d.), intravenous (i.v.) and
intranodal (i.n.) routes) and insufficient T-cell initiation[27], [140], [141]; 2) immunosuppressive TME
conspires to pose multifarious challenges that impede the tumor infiltration and immunological activity of
DCs, such as downregulating tumor-chemotaxis chemokine receptors (e.g. CCR5) on DCs to rust DCs’
migration capacity towards TME[85]. Predictably, with the satisfactory progress and harvest accumulated in
the development of gene engineering or nucleic acid delivery, it would be a practicable and impactful
attempt to directly elevate (or change) the expression of chemokine receptors on DCs in vivo and ex vivo, for
intelligently manoeuvre the tumor- and/or LNs- chemotaxis.
Adoptive transfer of in vitro genetically engineered DCs could display a manipulated motility. For instance,
Okada et al. found that intradermal reinfusion of DCs vaccine transduced with CCR7 and TAA/TSA
(gp100/OVA) gene through a fiber-mutant adenovirus (Ad) vector, elicited a more robust Ag-specific
immune response in melanoma-bearing mice with a lower dosage than DCs vaccine only genetically
engineered by Ag alone[108]. Similarly, Chen et al. adoptively transferred genetically recombined DCs
vaccines co-transfected by TAAs gp100- and CCR7-coding plasmid in B16BL6 melanoma-bearing mice,
promoting an increased influx of gp100-crosspresenting DCs into SLOs, which promised a DCs-vaccinesunleashed anti-melanoma immunity in vivo[109]. Robert et al. genetically modified DCs in vitro by
retroviral transduction to express a novel receptor for peripheral node addressin (PNAd) called chimeric E/Lselectin, and such engineered DCs could directly extravasate from the peripheral blood into the LNs after
venous reinfusion[110]. What’s more, Yang et al. intradermally administrated a OVA- and CCR7 pDNA-coloaded micelles (M-COSA) to support DC mobilization to LNs and boost MHC I-restricted Ag presentation in
B16-OVA melanoma models[112].
Besides, CCR5 is also expressed on immunoregulatory and tumor-promoting cells (e.g. M2 polarization
macrophages, Treg and MDSCs) and anti-CCR5 mAb therapeutics to decrease the abundance of
immunosuppressive cells mentioned above may be a promising strategy in anti-carcinoma of large
intestine. Hence, directly applying nonselective or indiscriminate gene engineering therapy to improve the
CCR5 expression in vivo, may lead to enhanced accumulation of pro-tumor cells instead of anti-tumor DCs
within TME[142]. On the other hand, reinfusion of DCs-based vaccines with high CCR5 expression, may be
beneficial to trafficking DCs into canceration regions. For instance, Lu et al. elevated the CCR5 expression on
adoptively transferred DCs vaccines through co-culturing in vitro-derived mo-DCs with tumor cells or their

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332223002457?via%3Dihub

Strategy and application of manipulating DCs chemotaxis in disease treatment and vaccine design - ScienceDirect

2/19/24, 11:28 AM

intracellular components, which polished up the in vivo chemotaxis towards TME[27].
Conversely, given that DCs can functionally elicit either immunogenic or tolerogenic immunity heavily lying
on their maturational state and positioning, consequently, during malgenic autoreactive immune response
or allografts, elevating SLOs-homing chemokine receptors on tolerogenic or immature DCs could contribute
to amplification the abundance of “tolerance executor” Treg in SLOs rather than that of “immune effector”
subsets. For example, Xin et al. co-overexpressed CCR7 and B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA) on
immature DCs via an Ad-based delivery, which simultaneously enhanced motility potential and tolerance
induction of DCs and provided a feasible choice for transplant recipients suffering from overwhelming graft
rejection[111]. Besides, Garrodr and colleagues indicated that reinfusing immature DCs co-expressing CCR7
and immunomodulatory molecule viral IL-10 could significantly extend cardiac allograft survival (mean
survival time even >100 days) in an immunoregulatory Treg subset expansion-dependent fashion[113].

3.1.3. Epigenetic reprogramming
Immunosuppressive TME function as an instrumental part in tumorigenesis, aggressive progression and
therapeutics response/resistance. Particularly, the epigenetic landscape within tumors is deregulated,
including the epigenetic regulation of tumor cells as well as immune cells present in the TME[143]. Despite
the specific mechanisms modulating the development and function of DCs in tumor-bearing hosts still
remain inadequately understood, complicated TME seems indeed to transcriptionally and epigenetically
alter biological activities and immunological phenotypes of DCs to hinder their multifunctional
orchestration in boosting anti-tumor immune responses (e.g. crippling tumor infiltration of DCs).
For instance, tumor-derived transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) could manipulate the H3K4
trimethylation (H3K4me3) and H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) modification of transcription factors
associated with expression of certain costimulatory molecules, cytokines/chemokines as well as receptors
in DCs, to force tolerance and dysfunction of DCs[144]. The relatively insufficient expression of CCR7 on moDCs mainly due to the Ccr7 promoter in mo-DCs enriched transcriptionally repressive histone modification
H3K27me3, compared to cDCs[145]. Besides, microRNA (miR)− 146a and miR-146b could provoke
intratumoral DCs apoptosis and block IL-12 and TNF-α production by modulating TRAF6 and IRAK1, and
miR-146a always aberrantly elevated in TIDCs within several types of tumor[146], [147]. Furthermore, miR155 targets special AT-rich binding protein 1 (Satb1, a master genomic coordinator for gene expression) in
ovarian cancer-associated DCs, driving differentiated DCs into an immature, hyporesponsive and tumorpromoting regulatory phenotype[148]. Hence, a more comprehensive understanding about how tumors
negatively affected immunological migration and competent capacity of DCs though epigenetic regulations
may be heavily beneficial to convert immunosuppressive TME into immunoresponsive types.
In these regards, epigenetic reprogramming tumor cells and/or immune cells within neoplasm regions to
heighten the expression of chemokine receptors on DCs appears to be an impactful way to reconstruct
tumor-reactive immune contexture. In fact, epigenetic modifying agents have been deemed as versatile and
booming therapeutics to restore endogenous tumor-killing immune responses[149] by reprogramming

Strategy and application of manipulating DCs chemotaxis in disease treatment and vaccine design - ScienceDirect

2/19/24, 11:28 AM

expression profiles of chemotactic factors- chemokine receptors and cytokines-cytokine receptors[150]. For
example, Fragale et al. combined IFN-α2b, romidepsin and 5-azacytidine (a type of DNA methyltransferase
inhibitors) to reactivate malfunctioned DCs in colorectal cancer-bearing mice targeting specific epigenetic
modifications, triggering upregulation of CXCR4-mediated pronounced navigation of DCs towards tumor
region[114]. Besides, Tu et al. manufactured a chidamide (CHI, a novel subtype-selective histone deacetylase
inhibitor)- and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS, chemical small-molecule inhibitors of PD-1/PD-L1 pathway)−
202-co-delivered liposome system for the treatment of 4T1 triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), boosting a
powerful anti-tumor immune response against TNBC by CHI-mediated amelioration of DCs immunological
function and enhanced tumor immunogenicity as well as BMS-202-based PD-L1 restriction[115]. A recent
clinical trial I demonstrated that tumor NY-ESO-1 vaccine (CDX-1401 + adjuvant (poly(I:C) in combination
with azanucleoside decitabine could abate the abnormal elevated promoter methylation levels in DCs,
augment the intratumoral/peritumoral CD141 + cDC1 frequency and enhance the maturity of CD141 + cDC1,
from patients suffering from malignant myelodysplastic syndromes[116].

3.1.4. Promoting CCR7 oligomerization
After activated by inflammatory stimulus, DCs upregulate the expression of CCR7 and subsequently form
CCR7 oligomers before or during their SLOs-targeting movement[117], and the hindered CCR7
oligomerization on DCs will remarkably depress DCs’ response degree or sensitiveness to the established
concentration gradient of CCL19/CCL21, provoking impaired SLOs homing competence on DCs[18].
Accordingly, pharmacologically promoting CCR7 oligomerization may be beneficial to DCs-based T-cell
immunoresponsive initiation in SLOs and inhibit the progression of immunodeficiency diseases (i.e. cancers,
some infections), and instead pharmacologically blocking the formation of CCR7 oligomer may suppress the
development of DCs-dependent autoimmune diseases, graft rejection or allergy.
For instance, Hauser and colleagues found that cholesterol-lowering drugs as well as Prostaglandin E2
(PGE2) could orchestrate inflammatory signals to further increase CCR7 oligomerization on DCs, which
positively modulated DC migration to LNs[117]. Interestingly, Angeli et al. discovered that dyslipidemia
associated with atherosclerosis may greatly crippled DCs’ homing capacity, leading to activated skin DCs
remained in situ and locally boosting dermal inflammation, and actually atherosclerosis is a common
clinical feature in autoimmune disorders (e.g. SLE, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriasis) with local
inflammation[118]. In these regards, cholesterol accumulation or atherosclerosis-associated dyslipidemia
may alter or impair DCs mobilization ability to LNs, and the retention of activated DCs populations may be
an important pathogenesis of autoimmune disorders mentioned above, and cholesterol-lowering drugs may
relieve symptoms caused by local inflammatory DCs with restricted mobilization.
Moreover, the exquisite metabolic transition from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis is indispensable
in forming and maintenance of CCR7 oligomer, in accordance with DCs maturation[18]. Therefore,
promoters of glycolytic metabolism may boost CCR7 oligomerization as well as SLOs-homing competence,
and inhibitors of that may function oppositely. Guak et al. utilized 2-Deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) to block DCs

glycolysis metabolism, which markedly decreased the DCs’ migration from the lung to the mediastinal LNs
in HDM-induced allergic asthma models[18].

3.1.5. Activating motion-related proteins/axis
Activation and maturation of DCs by stimuli such as multifarious DAMPs and PAMPs exposed during
bacterial invasion and malignant mutation always lead to exquisite transition in migratory patterns and
dramatic metabolic reprogramming. Migration of mature DCs is based with a continuous, motivated and
directional manner, rather than the random and patrol-like locomotion behaviors of immature DCs that
alternate their migration between fast and slow phases[151]. And such captivating change or difference in
motility patterns of DCs is mainly regulated and controlled by actin nucleation after sensing stimulus.
Actually, in several types of human and murine cancers, the actin organization-mediated DCs mobilization
is frequently damaged. For instance, DCs in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients are featured with
distempered actin organization capability, which also characterize crippled migration talent and insufficient
Ag-crosspresentation competence, due to the altered actin organization[152]. Thus, the regulation or
stimulation of DCs’ motion-related functional proteins/axis to alternate cytoskeletal organization may be a
fascinating strategy to dominate motility manners and chemotaxis of DCs.
For example, Bretour et al. pharmacologically stimulated lysosome-associated TFEB-TRPML1 (transcription
factor EB- transient receptor potential cation channel, mucolipin subfamily, member 1) pathway to
reorganize actin cytoskeleton and enhance the expression ratio of front:rear filamentous actin (F-actin) in
DCs to triggering a fast and mature-DCs-like locomotion manner, based with the fact that immature DCs
employ the F-actin at front to facilitate micropinocytosis and mature DCs concentrate F-actin at their rear to
boost cell motility[22]. Oliveira et al. found that Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASp) could act as an
effective actin regulator to coordinate several cytoskeletal reorganization-dependent behaviors such as
migration and cell-cell intercommunication in DCs via regulating the formation of DCs’ podosomes, and in
WAS patients featuring defective function WASp mutations usually suffered from immunodeficiency
partially due to the dysfunctional migratory capacity of DCs[153]. Besides, the carriers of an ASAP1 gene
variant have been proved possess an enhanced susceptibility to tuberculosis, for people with mutational or
defective ASAP1 gene exhibit migration deficiency of DCs and insufficient T-cell generation to deal with
Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection[154]. Diao et al. utilized low dose PGE2 to support the F-actin
cytoskeleton reorganization- and CCR7 expression-based DCs mobilization towards LNs[119]. Additionally,
Ufer et al. indicated that activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein/activity-regulated gene 3.1
(Arc/Arg3.1) pathway specifically determined the transformation from a steady and immature resting state
to accelerated and activated DC motility after migratory skin DCs encountered stimulus or inflammation,
and the genetic downregulation of Arc/Arg3.1 axis devoted a lot to the remission of allergic contact
dermatitis reaction and experimental autoimmune encephalitis, which implied Arc/Arg3.1 could be a
therapeutic target to modify DCs-based immunotherapy[23]. Furthermore, Eps8, fascin-1, formin
mammalian Diaphanous-related 1 (mDia) and actin-nucleating complex Arp2/3 all could act as modulators
for DCs locomotion-manners that are regulated by actin dynamics or meshwork architecture, whose

2/19/24, 11:28 AM

pharmacological activation and/or inhibition may contribute to the remission in immunologic deficiency
and/or immunologic overreaction diseases[120], [121].

3.2. Regulation of chemokine concentration in destinations
It’s well known that “tricky” tumors always establish overlapping mechanisms for immune privilege and
uncontrolled tumor progression. In fact, tumors could modify or change their chemokine expression profiles
and/or downregulate corresponding chemokine receptors in tumor-reactive immune cells to exclude
immunoresponsive populations. For instance, direct downregulation of chemokines CCL5, CXCL1 and CXCL2
in melanoma by expressing intrinsic β-catenin signal in melanoma[85] and adenocarcinoma of the uterine
cervix[155], altered the TIDCs (especially cDC1) landscape in TME as well as led to immune evasion.
Consequently, polishing up the immune-microenvironment of destination (e.g. cancer lesions with
immune-boosting chemotactic factor insufficiency) via direct delivery of chemokines or their nucleic acids,
enhancement of NK-DCs-based cascaded infiltration, and administration of DCs-stimulating or
development factors, may possess certain therapeutic value for ameliorated anti-tumor effectivity (Table 3,
Fig. 4B).

3.2.1. Direct delivery of chemokines or their nucleic acids
DCs’ trafficking into neoplasm sites is elaborately managed by multiple complicated chemoattractantschemokine receptors systems, and one of the simplest ways to interfere intratumoral/peritumoral
deployment of functional DCs is reducing supplies or production of chemoattractants attracting DCs into
tumor. Thus, direct delivery of potent chemotactic factors (e.g. CCL5, XCL1, CXCL12 and CCL19, CCL21) into
tumor regions, or forcing tumors themselves to produce and secrete guidance cues via delivering mRNA or
DNA of chemokines, may be an impactful strategy for chemotactic recruitment of DCs into TME.
3.2.1.1. XCL1
The chemokine receptor XCR1 is exclusively expressed on a cDC1 subpopulation involved in Ag crosspresentation, and XCR1 + cDC1 subtype is a critical or even indispensable component of mobilizing and
amplifying adaptive and innate immunity against malignancies[11]. In addition, the only two ligands
currently found for XCR1 are XCL1 and XCL2 (specific exists in human), both of which could engender
potent and highly specific chemotaxis of XCR1 + DCs, but not of any other activated or resting DC subsets, B
cells, T cells, or NK[79]. Therefore, targeted delivery of XCR1 ligands into tumor lesions may be an available
and efficacious approach to lead cDC1s into the TME.
Hartung et al. immunized mice with XCL1-OVA along with adjuvant LPS, which prevented tumor
progression of E.G7-OVA lymphadenoma via a OVA-specific CTLs immunity[156]. Matsuo et al. generated a
variant and stabilized form of XCL1 entitled mXCL1-V21C/A59C, which even possessed more potent
chemotactic and calcium-mediated cDCs mobilization competences after intradermal injected (along with
OVA) compared to wild type of XCL1[157].

2/19/24, 11:28 AM

Moreover, Chen et al. immunized hepatocellular carcinoma-bearing mice with XCL1/Glypican-3 fusion
pDNA vaccine, with amplified concentration of several functional cytokines and chemokines (e.g. XCL1,
CXCL19, CCL5, IFN-γ and granzyme B) in liver, which aroused potent Glypican-3-specific anti-tumor cellular
immunity and ameliorative anti–PD-1 efficacy[158]. Gao et al. transfected chemokines CCL19 or XCL1 cDNA
into several cancers via a recombinant Ad vector, and found that both XCL1 and CCL19 transfection delayed
murine lung cancer A549 and melanoma B16 progression[159]. However, another similar study
demonstrated that although both CCL19 and XCL1 were efficacious motif chemokines for DCs, impressively,
CCL19 transfection into ovarian carcinoma displayed a prominent tumor-suppressive efficacy, whereas XCL1
did not[160], which may closely related to that CCL19 expression tumor could attracted CCR7 + mature DCs
into TME or TLS and XCL1 could recruit immature XCR1 + DCs that may malfunction in immunosuppressive
TME[3], [11], [18].
3.2.1.2. CCL19/CCL21
The dynamics of cDC1 trafficking within tumors remains largely incomprehension, and it’s still unclear
whether cDC1s infiltrating into TME will eventually leave and migrate to TDLNs[183]. Furthermore,
considering the evidence recently found that promising naïve T cells and mature DCs actually could live and
intercommunicate in TLS[67], intratumorally administration of CCL19/CCL21 proteins/polypeptides or their
nucleic acid modes to boost a robust immune response to tumor may be a potential therapeutics to promote
mature DCs’ infiltration to immune-hostile TME. Because, such measure may massively heighten the
intratumoral/peritumoral frequency of CCR7 + DCs with activated biological activity as well as DC-T
crosstalk within tumor.
Wimalachandra synthesized folate-modified CCL21-loaded upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) (CCL21-FAUCNPs) for chemotactic recruitment of CCR7 + DCs and T cells from the vascular compartment into the
neoplastic lesions, augmenting the crippled host immune response in ovarian cancer[161]. Fenton et al.
fabricated a tunable and injectable biomaterial hydrogels constituted by CCL21-loaded self-healing and
shear-thinning polymer–nanoparticle (PNP), whose minimally invasive subcutaneous administration
professionally recruited DCs to injection site[162]. Intriguingly, Jorgensen et al. found that CCL21 exhibited
suboptimal chemotactic potency compared to CCL19 in provoking DCs migration, and CCL21 with removed
tail could display enhanced competence in glycosaminoglycan binding with CCR7 + DCs and orchestrating
initial cross-talk between DCs and naïve T cells in LN T-cell zones[62]. Besides, Zhao et al. generated a
CCL21/IL-15 bicistronic Ad carrier (Ad-CCL21-IL-15), whose intratumoral injection into CT-26-carrying mice
triggered chemotactic recruitment and stimulation of DCs, T cells and NK cells[163]. Liu et al. utilized folatemodified cationic nanoparticles to deliver CCL19 plasmid DNA (pDNA) into colon carcinoma, resulting in
activated immune system-mediated anti-tumor potency[164]. Analogously, Hisada et al. co-transfected
murine colon cancer cells CT-26 with chemokine CCL21 and costimulatory molecule LIGHT, which
synergistically promoted co-localization of mature DCs and T cells within tumor nodules and elicited a
colon carcinoma-specific CTLs immunologic activity[165].

2/19/24, 11:28 AM

3.2.1.3. CXCL12
Besides, some studies suggested that intratumoral upregulation of CXCL12 may devote to CXCR4 + DCs
locomotion into TME and correlate positively with suppressive tumor progression. For instance, Fushimi et
al. utilized adenoviral gene transfection of CXCL12 in A549 lung carcinoma, CT26 colon cancer and B16
melanoma, and expressed CXCL12 could function as a chemotactic factor for facilitating an influx of
immature CXCR4 + DCs into TME and succedent inflammatory enlargement of TDLNs and tumor
regression[166]. Analogously, Chen and colleagues generated CXCL12-loaded gold nanoparticles, which
evidently driven DCs to express CXCR4 and secrete more CXCL12 to further intercommunicate with nearby
DCs, contributing to migratory potential of mature DCs and initiation of acquired immune response[167].
Besides, Garnica et al. indicated that systematic administration of small amounts of CXCL12
supplementation could direct CXCR4 + DCs homing to spleen, where DCs initiated T cells into diversified
subtypes, accordingly augmenting the control against Plasmodium berghei malaria[168].
However, CXCL12/CXCR4 can be a two-edged sword in tumor progression. Under normal circumstances, the
expression of CXCL12 are upregulated during malignancy development under hypoxia, and large-scale
hyporesponsive and immunosuppressive Treg and myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) (rather than
tumor-suppressive DCs) could accumulated into TME in a CXCR4-based manner consequently. Then, the
increased tumor-infiltrating Treg and MDSC may even be positively intertwined with promoted
neoangiogenesis, invasion and metastasis[184], [185]. In brief, in clinical practice, CXCL12/CXCR4 overexpression predicts unfavorable overall survival and poor prognosis in malignancies, and the administration
of CXCR4 antagonist has been gradually regarded as a powerful weapon of recruiting intratumoral CD103 +
cDC1 and augmented anti-cancer immunity[185], which indicates that supplement of CXCL12 or its nucleic
acid modes needs to face the risk of potential tumor-promoting effect.

3.2.2. Augmentation of NK-DCs cascaded tumor-infiltration
It is worth a whistle that immune cells boosting the development, recruitment, Ag cross presentation and
maturation of DCs can be deemed as “DCs helper cells”[19]. In these regards, NK cells could be regarded as
such so called “DCs helper cells”. As the crucial force of innate immune system against malignancies, NK
cells usually precede cDC1s recruitment in several cancer models, and NK are the main producer of XCL1
and cytokine Flt3L associated with mobilization and generation of cDCs as wells. Hence, molecular
modulators regulating NK tracking and infiltration into TME could be significant determinants of
intratumoral/peritumoral cDC1s abundance or cascaded NK-DCs infiltration[11], [186]. In addition,
accumulated evidence demonstrates that intratumoral NK–DCs interaction axis defines the responsive
mode or efficacious degree of immunization therapies (including ICBs therapy) to cancers[186], whereas
tumors pose diversified suppressive challenges to exclude NK and DCs to interrupt such immunoreactive
crosstalk[169]. Therefore, facilitating tumor-infiltration of activated NK cells with biological capacity could
be a significant contributor to expansion and stimulation of DCs (especially cDC1) within TME.
3.2.2.1. COX-2 restriction
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332223002457?via%3Dihub

2/19/24, 11:28 AM

Notably, some researchers declared that metabolites of arachidonic acid (particularly PGE2) could act as a
proinflammatory mediator supporting DCs activation and adequate migration in prostate cancer, for low
concentration PGE2 could stimulate CCR7 oligomerization-based [187] and F-actin polymerization[119] LNshoming of mature DCs as well as enhance the expression of C5aR on mo-DCs and secretion of membranebound metalloproteinases (MMPs)[188]. Quite the contrary, other studies demonstrated that in several
types of cancer (e.g. melanoma, mammary cancer and carcinoma of colon), the rare distribution frequency
of TIDCs may be in part due to a tumor-derived high-concentration PGE2-mediated downregulation of XCR1
and dampened tumor-towards emigration of NK cells as well as the diminished production of NK-associated
XCL1 and CCL5[11], and PGE2 also appeared to be intertwined with the generation of immunosuppressive
indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO)[189] and tumor growth via immunity evasion[169]. As a consequence,
Böttcher et al. decreased the concentration of tumor-derived PGE2 through cyclooxygenase(COX)− 2
blockade to reinstate the tumor infiltration of functionally competent NK, which stimulated XCR1-and
CCL5- mediated chemotactic recruitment of cDC1 into TME to further synergistic activation of the immune
control against tumor[11]. Analogously, Zelenay et al. combined ICBs and selective depressant of COX
(aspirin) to effectually reverse tumor immune privilege via a cascaded NK-DCs tumor-infiltration and the
reinforced immune-promoting intercommunication between NK and DCs, implying the COX-2 restriction
may constitute efficacious additions to the arsenal of current anti-tumor immunization therapies[169].
3.2.2.2. Chemotactic factor receptor upregulation
Additionally, Maghazachi et al. used drugs for treating multiple sclerosis (such as glatiramer acetat,
monomethyl fumarate and dimethyl fumarate) to upregulate the expression of CCR10 on IL-2-activated NK
cells, which could respond to the concentration gradients of CCL27 and CCL28 that were secreted by
selective tumor types such as malignant melanoma, squamous cell carcinomas, and colorectal cancer,
respectively[170].
3.2.2.3. Chemokines replacement therapy
For example, supplying extra chemerin and its synthetic derivatives could biologically recruit DCs and NK
cells in vivo, leading to strengthened anti-tumor defense in multiple tumors (including melanoma,
mammary cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma)[81], [82], [83], [84]. Wendel et al. exogenously applied IFNγ–induced protein 10 (IP-10, or CXCL10) or forced tumor cells to ectopically produce CXCL10 via a retroviral
vector-delivered CXCL10 cDNA expanded intratumoral CXCR3 + NK population and prolonged NK cell–
dependent survival[171]. Specially, a phase II clinical trial results implied that the orally active antitumor
agent ONC201 could upregulate endogenous TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) both in tumor
cells and engender CXCL10-modulated CXCR3 + NK cells accumulation in tumor regions, arousing robust
NK- and CTLs-based immunity against tumor migration/invasion and metastasis[172].
3.2.2.4. Pro-inflammation cytokines
Wong et al. found that reinfusion of IL-18-primed “helper” NK cells could function as the prominent
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332223002457?via%3Dihub

Strategy and application of manipulating DCs chemotaxis in disease treatment and vaccine design - ScienceDirect

2/19/24, 11:28 AM

inducers of local immunoreactive immune cell accumulation, mobilizing the CCR5-modulated chemotactic
recruitment of immature DCs and inducing subsequent DCs secretion of CXCL9, CXCL10, and CCL5 to further
attract effector CTLs in hosts-bearing malignant caners[173]. Moreover, IL-17D replacement therapy or
doxycycline-pre-treated regressed cancer types with high IL-17D expression may stimulate production of
monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1, aka CCL2) and indirectly recruit NK cells into TME[174].

3.2.3. Administration of DCs-stimulus
The immunoreactivity and immunoresponse-mediated by Ag-carrying DCs are closely interrelated to total
number of available DCs, the chemotaxis of DCs (especially towards tumors and LNs), and the maturation
state or immunologic function of DCs in vivo[19]. In fact, all these immunological features could be
remarkably modulated by diversiform cytokines and transcription factors (e.g. IFN I, IFN III, IL-1β, TNF-α,
Notch ligand, Flt3L and GM-CSF) [190], [191]. On the contrast, the exist of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such
as IL-10 and TGF-β, negatively impact the biological activities and lead to tolerogenic properties, leadng to
diminished CTLs mobilization[144], [192]. Accordingly, exogenous application of other factorsclosely
associated with the development and maturation of DCs or triggering ectopic synthesis of these factors in
tumor cells or (adoptive transfer) immune cells would be attractive therapeutic means of eliciting immune
response against tumors as well.
3.2.3.1. Cytokines supplement
Interestingly, Oh et al. utilized gelatin-based hydrogel to co-deliver oncolytic adenovirus (Ad) co-secreting
IL-12 and GM-CSF and immature DCs for optimally long-term release of both therapeutics within immunehostile tumor lesions[175]. Administration of cGAMP or cGAMP–like agonists (e.g. cyclic seven-membered
ring (PC7A)) of STING (stimulating expression of IFN) seemed to stimulate the generation and secretion of
IFN I[176], as well as facilitating synergistic infiltration and activation of DCs and NK cells in TME[177],
[178]. Intriguingly, Haabeth et al. employed a CART delivery vehicle (BDK-CART)-mRNA delivery platform to
simultaneously provoke local expression of various immunomodulatory molecules (including IFN-γ, IL-12,
CD86, CD70, OX40L and CD80) in tumor cells or stoma cells, which reactivated a systemic immune response
to repress tumor invasion both in proximal (treated) and distal (untreated) tumors[180]. In addition,
supplying tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and RANTES are the main chemoattractants for attracting murine
LCs into LNs[193]. A recent phase I clinical research demonstrated that a personalized precision vaccine
composed of autologous tumor tissue that was transfected a pDNA encoding GM-CSF and bi-shRNA-furin to
attract DCs as well as suppress TGF-β expression, manifested a significant overall survival advantage in
advanced-stage ovarian cancer patients[179].
Moreover, Lai et al. adoptively transferred Flt3L-releasing T cells along with adjuvant poly (I:C) and anti-4–
1BB, which augmented the amount of intratumoral endogenous cDCs with robust Ag cross presentation
ability and substantially enhanced DC-T cell synergistic activation[181]. Kirkling et al. demonstrated coculture system containing Flt3L and OP9 stromal cells expressing the Notch ligand Delta-like 1 (OP9-DL1)
could engender optimal development of interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8)-dependent cDC1s with
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332223002457?via%3Dihub

2/19/24, 11:28 AM

optimizational competent properties in human and murine, which possessed a superior CCR7-based LNshoming behavior that caused a preferential T cell cross-priming talent and antitumor efficacy in vivo[194].
Importantly, a recent phase I/II clinical trial combined intratumoral Flt3L and poly (I:C) administration as
well as low-dose radiotherapy to convert low-grade B cell lymphomas into a Flt3L-primed in situ vaccine
manufacturing factories for DCs-development, recruitment and activation[182].
3.2.3.2. ICD inducers
Actually, apart from exposing immunologic adjuvant-like exogenous "danger signals" (such as ATP, HMGB1
and soluble F-actin mentioned above) to manipulate upregulated CCR7-based DCs mobilization behavior,
ICD inducers could also directly release chemoattractants for in situ recruitment of DCs. For instance, ICD,
not tolerogenic cell death, could massively chemokines (e.g. CXCL1, CXCL2, CCL2, and CXCL10), boost NK-DCT cascaded tumor-infiltration and synergetic stimulation[195]. Besides, tumor cells succumbing to CTs
triggering ICD (such as anthracyclines), would massively expose the chemotactic cue ANXA1 expressed on
their cell membrane. Then, the released ANXA1 could grant FPR1 + DCs entry into neoplastic lesions and
allowed FPR1 + DCs to cross-present TAAs/TSAs belonging to nearby dying cancer cells[28]. As a
consequence, breast and colorectal carcinoma patients characterizing a deficiency-of-function singlenucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in FPR1 seemed to possess poor prognosis after anthracycline or
oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy[28].

3.3. Modulating monocyte precursors infiltration and DCs differentiation
DCs as well as their monocyte precursors are both endowed with functional plasticity or flexibility to handle
with diversiform diseases. In brief, monocytes, as phagocytic effectors and short-lived transient
intermediates, could serve as BM-resident heterogeneous progenitors to seed peripheral tissues
(inflammatory sites mainly) with their progeny (including monocytes-derived DCs and macrophages) to
significantly mobilize innate and adaptive immune responses. Under normal circumstances, after egress
from BM, Ly6Chi CCR2 +[196] and/or Ly6Chi CCR6 +[41] inflammatory monocytes could provide a transient
functionally versatile complement to mo-DCs possessing Ag-cross-presenting capacity and tissue-resident
macrophage compartments to unleash immune defenses against microbes infection[196], [197], amplify
vaccine-sculptured immune responses[41], provoke inflammatory diseases[43], [198], and/or establish
peripheral tissues’ immune homeostasis[199]. Beside, Ly6Clow CX3CR1 + monocytes, which seem to be
differentiated by Ly6Chi monocytes returning to BM in the absence of inflammation[200], are apt to freely
patrol blood vessels and extravasate spontaneously to non-inflamed tissues to prepare for potential
infections, and Ly6Clow CX3CR1 + monocytes participate in the initial inflammatory response in infection
regions before Ly6Chi monocytes arrive in[201].
1) As a matter of fact, in comparison to infrequent progeny DCs subgroups, mononuclear precursors possess
a massive amount in vivo. Prior studies have established that the peripheral tissues are imbued with
circulating monocytes or their progenies owing to the exquisite deployment of monocytes
populations[202]. For example, Ly6Clow CX3CR1 + monocytes can give rise to CX3CR1 + DCs to preserve
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332223002457?via%3Dihub

Page 38 of 106

Strategy and application of manipulating DCs chemotaxis in disease treatment and vaccine design - ScienceDirect

2/19/24, 11:28 AM

internal homeostasis by eliminating pathogenic bacterium/virus or triggering tolerance to food-Ag and SI
symbiodinium in gastrointestinal tract[203]. Furthermore, elegant studies about migration kinetic and
differentiation kinetic of adoptively transferred monocytes have illustrated that, Ly6Chi monocytes are more
potential to give rise to CD103 + DCs, whereas LY6Clow monocytes are more likely to generate CD11b+ DCs in
lung[204], [205].
2) In addition, monocyte precursor cells (especially Ly6Chi) instinctively feature more potent inflammatory
chemotaxis in vivo, no matter towards common inflammatory locus (e.g. pathological infection regions), or
towards neoplastic lesions or vaccine inoculation sites. For instance, after antineoplastic therapeutics induce
ICD, the intratumoral infiltration abundance of mononuclear progenitors is fairly more than that of DCs,
which may be attributed to the fact that disparate DAMPs including soluble fragments of fractalkine
(CX3CL1), the lipid lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), S1P and the nucleotides ATP and UTP all could provide
“find-me” signals exposed by cancer cells for monocytes[206].
3) Furthermore, as a nonconventional and highly plastic DCs subtype, it remains unknown whether mo-DCs
are generated elsewhere to be advisedly attracted to the inflammatory regions in response to
chemoattractants for DCs’ recruitment, or they are developed from inflammation-infiltrating progenitor
monocytes and activated in situ. But whether or not, it displays better practicability or simplification to
recruit monocyte precursors that characterize robust inflammatory chemotaxis as well as differentiation
potential and then to facilitate monocytes’ in situ differentiation into multifunctional DCs, compared to
directly attracting rare DC populations. Generally, administration of ICD inducers and adjuvant components,
and chemokine supplement may be efficacious approaches for trafficking Ly6Chi monocytes into the
destinations (Fig. 4C).

3.3.1. ICD inducers
Ma et al. found that the anthracyclines could effectually boost large-scale CD11c+CD11b+Ly6Chi cells
accumulation in tumor bed, and these Ly6Chi cells characterized with monocytic precursors together with
some differentiated inflammatory DCs, which could efficiently engulf exposed TAAs/TSAs after ICD and then
successfully cross presented captured-Ags to T lymphocytes[207]. Specially, ATP seemed to favor
monocytes’ tumor infiltration and their succedent differentiation to DCs during anthracyclines-triggered
ICD[207]. Besides, massive CCL2 that released during tumor ICD also participated in trafficking monocytic
precursors into TME[195], despite depletion of tumor-derived CCL2 could block breast-tumor metastatic
seeding and CCL2-CCR2 recruited inflammatory monocytes may sometimes support metastasis because
monocytes also could develop into immunosuppressive M2 as well[208].

3.3.2. Adjuvant administration
Several established studies demonstrated that intramuscular immunization of MF59 (a FDA-approved
emulsion-based vaccine adjuvant) as well as adjuvant System AS03[209] could construct an
“immunocompetent environment” in situ by producing manifold guidance cues (such as CCL2, CCL4, CCL5
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332223002457?via%3Dihub

2/19/24, 11:28 AM

and CXCL8), directly conferring the capacity to enter injection sites on CCR2 + CCR5 + inflammatory
monocytes, which could further differentiate into mo-DCs to elicit vaccine-specific immune responses[210],
[211]. Similarly, Lian et al. generated an oil formulation loading adjuvants and Ags to attract monocytes and
endow them with the capacity to migrate into interfollicular regions (IFRs) of LNs, where they developed
into Ag-presenting mo-DCs and further recruited and initiated CD4 + T cells[212].

3.3.3. Chemokine supplement
What’s more, monocytes, serving as precursors of mo-DCs, after transepithelial or transdermal
immunization could navigate to the vaccine inoculation sites with the guidance of CCR6-CCL20 axis, and in
situ development into DCs that are accomplished in Ag-Specific CD8 + T cell priming[41]. Cao et al.
administrated recombinant macrophage inflammatory protein 1α (MIP-1α) could mobilize CCR2 + or CCR6
+ DCs precursors into circulation, and further adoptive transfer of human melanoma-associated gene
(MAGE)− 1-transfected DCs-derived from MIP-1α–mobilized circulating precursors could trigger CTLs
expansion and abolish tumor development[213].
In summary, despite there exist a large number of practicable approaches for chemotactic or inflammatory
recruitment of monocytic precursors into tumor lesions and monocytes indeed greatly possess latent
capacity to differentiate into DCs that feature with expert Ag-cross-presentation competence, inflammatory
monocyte precursor cells pose more potential to develop into macrophages (particularly immune-hostile
M2) in immunosuppressive TME, leading to tumor immune privilege and metastasis of tumor[208], [214],
[215]. In these regards, to avoid recruited monocytes in situ transform into tolerogenic M2 instead of tumorinfiltrating mo-DCs, appropriate combination with immunotherapies mentioned above that favor
development and maturation of DCs may be a valuable strategy, for example ectogenic complementarity or
genetic transfection of Flt3L and GM-CSF[175], [181], [182], [194].

3.4. Physical method-manipulated DCs locomotion
Except for physiological chemokine-chemokine receptor systems-regulated DCs chemotaxis in vivo, some
recent reports manifested that physical methods could participate in manipulating DCs directional
migration and tracking DCs’ motility without invasiveness as well (Fig. 4D).
For instance, Jin et al. utilized fluorescent magnetic nanoparticles (α-AP-fmNPs consisted of Ag gp100, iron
oxide nanoparticles, and indocyanine green (ICG)) together with magnetic pull force to manipulate DCs
directional motility in vivo and ex vivo, and reinfused mo-DCs with internalizationof α-AP-fmNPs could
favorably position LNs under the guidance of magnetic pull force and inflammatory stimulation of tumor
necrosis factor (TNF)-α, which boosted amplified anti-melanoma immunity[216]. Similarly, Schreiber et al.
reported a fluorescent carbon magnetic nanoparticles (CMNPs) along with TLR9 agonist CpG to stimulate
DCs that endocytosed CMNPs, and these activated DCs could be enriched into either SLOs or chronic
inflammation sites in vivo by an external magnet-based magnetic pull force[217].

Therefore, physical method may be an effective alternative to mediate DCs enrichment into SLOs to elicit
multiplicate T-cell subsets-based immune responses or immunological tolerance as well as into inflamed
foci to capture Ags and subsequently (re)stimulate and expand T cells.

4. Clinical applications of manipulating DCs chemotaxis for immune amplification and
immune tolerance
Emerging evidence from clinical trials or practices exhibits that immunization therapies based on
modulating DCs chemotaxis to SLOs or peripheral inflammation foci (especially neoplastic lesions) could be
efficacious contributors to repress malignancies progression and attenuate infections via boosting adaptive
and innate immunity, or relieve inflamed diseases (an extensive term, including tissue inflammations and
autoimmune diseases) via inducing immunological tolerance. Generally, DCs-based immunotherapies to
amplify immune responses are mainly composed of protein-based vaccines, nucleic acid-based vaccines
(including mRNA and DNA) and reinfused DCs-based vaccines, whose robust potencies actually are
positively correlated with their competence in regulating migratory behavior and in vivo positioning either
in hosts’ intrinsic DCs or adoptively transferred DCs generated in vitro. Oppositely, clinically therapeutic
regimens for organ inflammation and autoimmune diseases, are mainly constituted of immune inhibitors to
prevent maturation and SLOs-homing of DCs (Table 4, Table 5).

vaccines. As one of the most widely utilized vaccine types in clinical practice, protein/peptide-based
vaccines, which are composed of antigenic disease-associated proteins/peptides and immunogenic
adjuvants and are mainly delivered via i.m., i.d., s.c., and i.n., are used in anti-tumor and anti-virus therapies
for both prevention as well as therapeutics via boosted immune responses. (B) Nucleic acid-based vaccines.
As a novel and effective vaccine kind, nucleic acid-based vaccines, which include disease-related Agsencoding pDNA or mRNA with robust self-adjuvant effect, could be administrated by i.m., i.d. and s.c. routes,
for either prophylactic or therapeutic strategies through magnified immune responses. (C) DC-based

2/19/24, 11:28 AM

Modern vaccines are one of the most important weapons for humans against pathogenic attack[250] and
malignancy progression[27]. Prominently, considering peptide- and/or protein-based vaccines feature safe
biocompatibility, storage stability and well maneuverability (or simplification) to manufacture at quantity
between the batch, they are nearly the most commonly used vaccine types in clinical research and practice.
In addition, just as mentioned above, the immune adjuvants usually are the indispensable components in
the most protein-based vaccines in clinical applications for amplified immune responses by polishing up
the diversified costimulatory molecules and p-MHC molecules, and the appropriate administration of
adjuvants could upregulate chemokine receptor CCR7-based directional SLOs-towards chemotaxis by
ameliorating the maturity of DCs[73], [98]. Besides, after localized injection, adjuvants, the analogues of
DAMPs and PAMPs, could recruit massive pre-DCs and rapidly promote the precursor cells’ differentiation
into multifunctional DCs in situ[209], [212]. Hence, the protein-based vaccines containing potent adjuvant
components are significant measures to manipulate DCs trafficking.
Specially, among a large number of prophylactic or therapeutic vaccines against malignancies, the
multivalent (including bivalent vaccines (2vHPV, Cervarix), tetravalent vaccines (4vHPV, Gardasil) and ninevalent vaccines (9vHPV, Gardasil 9)) vaccines, is first and currently the only one successfully prevented
cancers[218]. In detail, this vaccine is composed of DNA-free HPV virus-like particles (VLP) with “high risk”
(such as HPV16 and HPV18) or “low risk” (such as HPV6 and HPV11) and immunogenic adjuvants (such as
AS04, aluminum hydroxide and aluminum hydroxy diphosphosulfate). In fact, the past decade has
witnessed that large-scale vaccination of the DNA-free HPV VLP-based vaccine has almost eliminated
cervical carcinomas in 14 high-income countries, as well as eased the burden of HPV-provoked other
carcinomas (e.g. cervical carcinoma and vagina carcinoma) and genital warts[251]. Accordingly, viral cancers
containing HPV-engendered cervical carcinoma and Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV or HHV8)-induced
Kaposi sarcoma, have been gradually characterized as the “low-hanging fruit”, for which could potentially
be prevented via an appropriate immunization[252].
Besides, other clinical research involving immunizing long peptides (IMP)-based anti-neoplasm vaccines
also harvested some delectable progress. For instance, a phase I/II clinical trial of combining CDX-301
(composed of Flt3L and poly(IC:LC)) and local radiotherapy (RT) as well as PD-1 monoclonal antibody
(mAb), significantly expanded intratumoral CD141 + cDC1 subgroup with activated immunological function,
leading to the regressions of distant (untreated) lymphomas[222]. Therapeutic lung adenocarcinoma
vaccine utilized the combination of chemotactic factor CCL21 and bystander cells expressing GM-CSF and
CD40L, prominently increased mature DCs’ accumulation in adenocarcinoma foci[225]. In addition, another
phase I clinical research exhibited that CDX-1401 (constituted of DCs-targeting DEC205 mAb fused TAA NYESO-1) together with resiquimod and poly(IC: LC) and PD-1 mAb, promoted robust humoral and cellular
immunity in patients bearing diversified solid tumors, and even induced objective tumor regression in 6/8
patients that received PD-1 mAb therapy[230]. Interestingly, an oral anti-carcinoma drug ONC201 along
with PD-1 mAb augmented cascaded or synergic tumor-infiltration and stimulation of NK-DC-T cells, and
regressed partial metastatic lesions in individuals suffering from prostate and endometrial cancers[172],
[223].

2/19/24, 11:28 AM

In sum, for Ag-reactive immune responses amplification, several principles in protein-based vaccine design
include: 1) as a cardinal part of a potent and targeted vaccine, the carefully screened Ags (from virus or
cancer) should possess high antigenicity, extensive and specific expression in targeted foci, and
immunogenicity[219]; 2) as described above, antigenic protein or peptide-based vaccines need the
combination of immunogenic adjuvants (TLR-3 agonist poly(IC: LC) in clinical particularly) to improve the
sufficient persistence, efficiency, and breadth in Ag-reactive immune responses[116]; 3) considering the
restricted in vivo migration of DCs in tumor-bearing individuals, it’s necessary to ensure DCs or their
mononuclear precursors could reach the immunization sites and then the activated DCs carrying Agepitopes could rapidly migrate to SLOs where they share antigenic information and orchestrate Ag-specific
immune responses[182], [225]; 4) considering the differential chemotactic responses and bio-distribution
under different injection routes and the diversified strength and duration of immune responses under
different vaccination dosage and frequency, appropriate administration routes, dosage and frequency of
vaccine inoculation need to be further explored or unified to ensure an optimum induction of DCs-based
immunity[253], [254]; 5) given the involute TME provided variegated immunosuppressive molecules, thus,
in therapeutic vaccines (to defense tumor especially), combining with other (immune)therapies (e.g. CT, RT,
ICBs, chemokine supplementation and cytokine therapies) may be an essential strategy[227].

4.1.2. Nucleic acid-based vaccines
As described above, in comparison with protein subunit vaccines in insufficient immunogenicity, nucleic
acids (including DNA and RNA)-based vaccines are characterized with self-adjuvant effect via their PAMPslike molecular structure to adequately stimulate PRRs (such as TLR-3/−7/−8/−9) on/within DCs, which could
directly attract and subsequently activate neighboring monocyte progenitors as well as dermal cDCs and
LCs, inducing immune responses amplification via plenty of Ag-carrying DCs homing to LNs in a CCR7dependent manner[102]. Furthermore, recently highlighted advances in the design, modification,
purification, production, storage and in vivo delivery of nucleic acids have endowed the progression of
nucleic acid-based prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatments for extensive applications in clinical.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2), features a high infection rate and complex and highly variable disease pathology[255]. Specially,
due to the approval of several mRNA-based vaccines in the COVID-19 pandemic, nucleic acids (particularly
mRNA)-based vaccines enter a rapidly emerging or development stage, or a new era in vaccinology[131], for
which promise a versatile, efficacious and self-adjuvant novel vaccine-platforms[231]. Actually, mRNA is
transiently expressed and theoretically won’t integrate into the genome of the hosts, and mRNA can be
optimized for enhanced serum stability and translation/transfection efficiency under appropriate delivery
carrier[255]. It deserves to be mentioned, mRNA-based BNT162b1, one of the most advanced lipid
nanoparticle (LNP)-encapsulated mRNA vaccine candidates against COVID-19, encodes the receptor-binding
domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which acts as a critical target of neutralizing antibodies. And
the results from clinical trials and subsequently large-scale vaccination manifested several LNP-loaded
mRNA vaccine candidates (especially the advanced one BNT162b1 from Pfizer and mRNA-1273 from
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332223002457?via%3Dihub

Moderna) with endurable or slight side effect could orchestrate both cellular immunity and humoral
immunity after multiple vaccination, consequently, providing a durable protection against severe disease,
hospitalization, and death caused by COVID-19[231], [255]. Additionally, a clinical phase I trial against
melanoma as well as a clinical phase I/II trial against gastrointestinal cancer both employed mRNA-based
vaccines that encoded less than 20 individual IMP or mutant peptides of the hosts, which seemed to display
a sustained progression-free survival in immunized patients[234], [235].
Back in the early 1990 s, DNA-based vaccines show up prominently and suddenly develop into the scientific
limelight. Similar to mRNA vaccines, Ag-encoded DNA-based vaccines could transfect both APCs (mainly
refer to dermal cDCs, LCs and mo-DCs as well as undifferentiated monocyte progenitor cells) and somatic
cells (such as keratinocytes and myocytes) after local administration, and unleash robust Ag-reactive
humoral immunity and cellular immunity with the participation of exquisite antigenic information transfer
or share in situ and in SLOs[7]. Despite up to now there exists no DNA-based vaccine has been listed on
market, because of people’s concerns about the potential risks of genome integration caused by delivered
ectogenic DNA, the past decades witnessed massive clinical researches about DNA vaccines involving
diversified causative/pathogenic agents and TAAs/TSAs[256]. For example, two phase II trials in cervical
carcinoma patients both used pDNA encoding proteins (E6, E7) from high risk HPV16 and/or HPV18 subtype,
eliciting efficacious Th1 immunity, which showed more possibility to eliminate HPV 16/18 and induce
histopathologic regression carcinoma of compared to placebo group[232], [233]. Furthermore, GLS-5700 in
phase I trial I was also a DNA vaccine encoding premembrane and envelope proteins of Zika virus, which
could provide virus-specific antibodies for defensing from Zika virus infection[236].
In brief, for well biosafety and boosting immune responses, rules in nucleic acid-based vaccine design
should include: 1) optimized encoding associated with target proteins/peptides featuring high specificity,
biocompatibility and immunogenicity, just similar to the “principle 1)” in protein subunit vaccine; 2)
optimizational delivery or encapsulation technology for better stabilization and transfection efficiency; 3)
considering stroma cells without costimulatory molecules and pro-inflammatory cytokine-secreting
competence, also could capture the nucleic acids, translate corresponding Ag and present on their MHC I
molecules to serve as tolerogenic “APCs-like” cells, which may lead to Ag-responsive T cell exhaustion or
initiate Treg-dependent tolerance induction, thus，appropriate adjuvants (if necessary) and administration
dosage, frequency and routes are indispensable to avoid unnecessary (but overwhelming) inflammatory
reaction in injection sites and acquire robust Ag-specific responses; 4) as the complexed and
immunosuppressive state in TME, combination immunotherapies should be carefully considered.

4.1.3. DCs-based vaccines
Despite DCs, especially cDC1, are adept at Ag cross presentation and polyfunctional T cell priming, they are
regularly excluded in the very early stage of progressive tumor development. Besides, DCs’ in vivo
generation, migration and maturation are obstructed by the systematic immune tolerance induced by
tumor, leading to inadequate tumor-infiltration of immunoreactive cell populations (DCs, NK and CTLs) and

poor clinical outcomes[10], [11]. In fact, according to the meta-analysis results from various human cancers,
the pre-existing immune contexture within TME, heterogeneous across patients, may be of significant
prognostic value in multiple types of human malignancy[67]. Immunological landscape within TME is
gradually regarded as a predictive biomarker of response and sensitivity to several immunotherapies,
including immune checkpoint blockade (ICB, e.g. PD-1 mAb) and multiple protein- or T cell-based vaccines
therapeutics[3], [27]. In addition, although cancer immunotherapy is an emerging and boomingly evolving
field and still making progress, its long-term response rates keep in a modest level around 20–40%[257],
which may be largely interrelated to restricted tumor infiltration of tumor-reactive immune cells and their
stagnant proliferation in TME during tumor rejection[258]. In these regards, large-scale reinfusion of in vitro
expanded and activated DCs that presented diversiform epitopes of TAAs/TSAs, may convert the
immunosuppressive immune landscape in TME and favorably facilitate promoted anti-carcinoma responses
and rebuild immunological surveillance[3], [243].
In general, the preparation steps of in vitro-generated and -activated DCs vaccines used for adoptive transfer
commonly include: 1) separation and extraction of DC precursor cells, including human allogeneic or
autologous CD34+ progenitor cells from BM and CD14+ monocyte progenitors in peripheral blood
monouclear cells (PBMCs), which could differentiate into DCs (mainly mo-DCs) via the stimulation of GMCSF and IL-4[259]; 2) the pulse of IMP mixture of TAAs/TSAs or autologous tumor lysate (with or without
immunogenic adjuvants) to activate immature DCs for cross-presentation of epitopes[241]; 3) adopting
appropriate administration (mainly subcutaneous, intradermal or intravenous injection) to reinfuse the
Ags-carrying DCs vaccines (Fig. 6).

Fig. 6. Reinfusion of in vitro-derived and activated DCs vaccines. Personalized DCs vaccines employed in
anti-cancer therapy are mainly generated from GM-CSF- and IL-4-treated CD34+ progenitors and/or CD14+
mononuclear precursors that extracted from BM and/or PB, and then the differentiated immature mo-DCs
would be further pulsed with individualized TAAs/TSAs or tumor lysate for cross presenting more specific
Ag epitopes and eliciting tumor-reactive T-cell immune responses. PB: peripheral blood; BM: bone marrow;
GM-CSF: granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor.

To be worthy of attention, the antigenic IMP or autologous tumor lysate alone in stimulation DCs and
subsequent restoration of the systemic immunity with hyporesponsiveness may be quietly insufficient,
because of the complicated immune hostile molecules or cues conspired by tumors to obtain immunologic
escape or privilege[153]. For example, the results from a phase III clinical trial and a phase IIb clinical trial
associated with mo-DCs respectively pulsed with multiple IMP or autologous tumor lysate in advanced
melanoma patients, manifested that no extra superiority or benefit was found compared with the
controlled group[244], [245]. Analogously, a phase II research against glioblastoma via reinfusing mo-DCs
pulsed with autologous tumor lysate also didn’t devote to prolong the overall and progression-free survival

in hosts accepting several doses of indicated DCs vaccines[241]. The dissatisfactory or inadequate antitumor curative effect may be partially related to 1) the inherent deficiency of mo-DCs in CCR7 expression
and T cell priming compared the cDCs; and 2) the systematic immune tolerance or silence[140].
Therefore, to further mobilize adoptive transfer individualized DCs-based vaccines as well as intrinsic or
naturally developed DCs in vivo, optimized combinatorial immunotherapy by combining with exogenous
chemokines supplement, ICD inducers and ICBs, may be a viable alternative to augment the tumor
regression in cancer treatment. For example, intratumoral injection of CCL21-overexpressed autologous moDCs could chemotactically attract mature DCs (intrinsic DC subgroups in vivo) entry into TLS within
neoplastic lesions and reinstate systemic tumor Ag–specific immune responses in non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) patients[242]. Intriguingly, a phase I research against glioblastoma created a novel approach
through the pre-condition of potent recall Ags (such as tetanus and diphtheria toxoid) in vaccine sites to
heighten the LNs-homing capacity of injected DCs vaccines, and the administration of extra CCL3 further
promoted the DC-T crosstalk in LNs, which significantly elevated DCs migration to LNs bilaterally and
prominently improved patients’ survival[237]. In additional, the combination with ICD inducers (CT and/or
RT) could elicite robust TAAs/TSAs- specific immunity in almost half of glioblastoma patients[238], [239],
and similar situation happened under the combination therapy composed of IFN-γ, LPS and Audencelpulsed autologous mo-DCs[240].
In summary, although prospective tolerability, well biocompatibility and immunogenicity profiles, there are
still several limitations or insufficiencies in the anti-cancer clinical trials or clinical practices of current DCsbased vaccines[241], [260]. 1) mo-DCs are the commonest type of DC subset utilized in clinical reinfusion
for their relative simplification in manufacturing or expansion in vitro process compared to cDCs, however,
their inadequate biological functions in CCR7-modulated SLOs-homing and in vivo IL-12- as well as Agcross-presentation-based T cell mobilization, to a great extent, block the initiation of Ag-reactive immunity.
As a matter of fact, after local administration (subcutaneous or intracutaneous), most of mo-DCs vaccines
would be restricted in injection site and then lose viability or directly undergo apoptosis, which may be
eliminated by the inflammatory-infiltrating macrophages soon afterwards[141], whereas some existing Ag
transfer behavior may promoting Ag-specific immune responses to a degree[7]. 2) The ex vivo generation
process of a pure population of cDCs (particularly cDC1) that characterize robust T cell activation and
expansion competence as well as motility ability towards tumor lesions and SLOs, is actually more difficult,
expensive, complicated and time-consuming than established manufacturing protocols of mo-DCs, whereas
the producing methods of the latter are complexed as well. In fact, the insufficiency of (simply) approaches
for the preparation of functional cDC1-like cells has been a significant bottleneck in clinical progression of
DCs-based therapeutic cancer vaccines[261]. Besides, it’s also quite difficult to guarantee the quality
agreement of ex vivo-derived DCs between batches. 3) As an aggressive and progressive immune disorder,
cancer could systematically suppress the adaptive as well as the innate immunity via a complex
immunosuppressive network composed of tumor cells, tumor stroma cells together with tolerogenic
immune cells (including Treg, MDSCs and M2) to provoke dysfunction in DCs and T cells. Consequently, it’s
hard for exogenous DCs vaccines, nucleic acid vaccines or protein vaccines (even if adjuvants exist) alone to
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332223002457?via%3Dihub

Page 54 of 106

2/19/24, 11:28 AM

completely eliminate tumor burden in patients, calling for elaborately orchestrated combinatorial
immunotherapies to reactivate malfunctioned DCs and effector cells for synergistically resetting the
systemic immune landscape. 4) Given that immunosuppressive molecules may exist in tumor whole cell
lysate, hence, DCs that directly contact with tumor lysate may result in low maturity or tolerogenic
phenotypes, and reinfusion of such regulatory DCs vaccine may trigger tumor-reactive effector T cells
exhaust and expand the Treg subgroup instead[27], [262].

4.2. Immune tolerance
Conventionally, DCs featuring a stably semi-mature phenotype (anti-inflammatory membrane molecules) as
well as immunomodulating attributes (secreting anti-inflammatory products) are termed as tolerogenic DCs
(tolDCs), which could amplify the abundance of tolerogenic Treg subtype and delete or exhaust the
autoreactive cytotoxic T cells to maintain long-term peripheral tolerance and ameliorate or ease
overwhelming autoimmune destruction and GvHD.
Generally, current DCs-participated clinical immunomodulation therapies mainly comprise 1) reinfusion of
in vitro-generated tolDCs pulsed with disease-specific Ags with negligible immunogenicity, for further
reeducating the immune system in an Ag-specific mode by priming regulatory Ag-specific Treg[123]; and 2)
administration of immunosuppressive drugs (such as 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, rapamycin, cyclosporin,
tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and glucocorticoids) to systematically inhibit the maturation of hosts’
inherent DCs for reduced LNs-homing and CTLs initiation in vivo.
Clinical trials involving modulating DCs locomotion in vivo for regulatory immunomodulation in antiinflammation treatment against various chronic-inflammatory or autoimmune diseases as well as GvHD
(Table 5, Fig. 7) are displayed herein.

Fig. 7. Clinical applications of regulating DCs migration for immune tolerance. (A) DC-based vaccines. The
adoptively transferred DCs vaccines are mainly composed of heterogeneous tolDCs loaded with/without
disease-specific Ags for unleashing (Ag-specific) Treg-based tolerance induction and (Ag-specific) effector T
cells deletion. Besides, the administration (i.m., i.d. i.v., i.n. and s.c.) of tolDCs could ameliorate the
progression of autoimmune diseases, tissue/organic inflammations and GvHD in vivo. (B)
Immunoregulatory drugs. To 1) inhibit the maturation and migration both towards LNs as well as inflamed
focus, 2) induce tolDCs generation in vivo or 3) change the immune bias/balance of Th1/Th17 and Th2
induced by DCs, immunoregulatory drugs are administrated through taking orally, i.v. and i.p. and used to
provoke immune tolerance for prevent or treat inflammatory disorders. i.d.: intradermal injection; i.v.:
intravenous injection; s.c.: subcutaneous injection; i.n.: intranodal injection; i.m.: intramuscular injection;
GvHD: graft versus host disease.

4.2.1. Reinfusion of tolDCs
Direct separation and purification of immature DCs or tolDCs in PBMCs are quite tough, because the
infrequent human DC subsets are characterized with immunogenic attributes rather than tolerogenic
properties under inflammatory conditions[275]. Fortunately, like the ex vivo-derived mo-DCs used in
therapeutic anti-tumor vaccines, the protocols to in vitro manufacture tolDCs with hyporesponsiveness
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332223002457?via%3Dihub

have been described. In brief, during the process of isolated CD14 + or CD34 + mononuclear progenitors
differentiate into immature mo-DCs, diversified tolerance-inducing agents or biomolecules are extra added
to generate heterogeneous tolDCs, although there exists still no definite consensus on what is the optimal
method or how to choose (or combine) complicated immunosuppressive agents to engender superior DC
tolerogenicity for optimized anti-inflammation effectiveness[192].
In addition, it is noteworthy that synthetic and endogenous molecules used to trigger tolerogenic features in
in vitro-generated mo-DCs, mainly including vitamin D3, rapamycin, minocycline, glucocorticoids, IL-10,
TGF-β and ethyl pyruvate[192]. For example, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 has been recently reported to
induce stable and reproducible therapeutic tolDCs via differential DNA methylation modification in DCs'
metabolic and immune pathway[276]. Intriguingly, in a phase I clinical research, antisense ODNs targeting
co-stimulating molecules (CD40, CD80 and CD86) were employed to pre-treat autologous mo-DCs for a
stable and immature phonotype, although the intradermal reinfusion of such DCs-based vaccine seemed to
not arouse any significant clinical effect in patients bearing type 1 diabetes[263]. Moreover, intraperitoneal
injection of dexamethasone (Dex)-induced autologous tolDCs has been proved to polish up life quality in
3/9 Crohn’s disease patients because of the augmentation of circulating Treg and the reduction of IFN-γ
concentration[264].
Besides, immunomodulatory tolDCs exposed to specific autoantigens or inflammatory disease-associated
Ags could potentiate the ability to suppress persistent inflammation by reeducating the immune system in
an Ag-specific manner[123], [266]. For instance, a phase I clinical trial against rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
generated a 4 citrullinated peptide Ags pulsed autologous tolDC vaccine that was modified with an NF-κB
inhibitor, whose intracutaneous administration evidently enlarged the ratio of regulatory to effector T cells
and crippled the concentration of pro-inflammatory IL-15, IL-29, CX3CL1 and CXCL11 (the guidance cue
secreted by activated DCs to recruit NK and effector T cells) in serum[266]. Furthermore, without the
participant of adjuvants with potent immunogenicity, the tolDCs respectively pulsed with proinsulin
peptide C19-A3, aquaporin-4 or myelin-derived peptides could protect the hosts from destructive
autoimmunity by eliciting disease-specific Treg-based IL-10 production in patients bearing type 1 diabetes,
neuromyelitis opticaspectrum disorders or multiple sclerosis[123], [267].
In summary, opposite to keep immunological function of therapeutic DCs vaccines under systemic
immunosuppressive condition in neoplasms, how to maintain the immunomodulatory characteristics in
adoptively transferred tolDCs-based vaccines in inflammatory environment is the pivotal role or one of the
biggest challenges to ameliorate or cure chronic-inflammation, autoimmune diseases and GvHD[275].
However, mature DCs are the crime culprits in orchestrating persistent Ag-specific inflammation disorders
in vivo, and the multifarious inflammatory stimulus in vivo may convert exogenous semi-mature DCs into
activated DCs with effector T cells initiation competence, which may face the risk to increase instead of
easing the burden of intrinsic inflammation[265]. Consequently, both of understanding the mechanisms
that underlie stable immunoregulatory properties in DCs and further optimizing the protocols for yielding
disease Ag-specific tolDCs-based vaccines with preserved semi-mature or immature immunological
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332223002457?via%3Dihub

features even when facing inflammatory stimulations are prominent.

4.2.2. Administration of immunosuppressive drugs
Commonly, the mechanisms of immunosuppressive drugs applied in clinical practice and researches to
ameliorate pernicious inflammation-provoked chronic or acute organ-inflammation, autoimmune diseases
and GvHD, mainly involve 1) impeding the inflamed focus-infiltration of activated DCs and effectors to
cripple the Ags capture and cross presentation and in situ effectors (re)stimulation and expansion, and 2)
directly hampering the SLOs-homing competence of mature DCs (or inducing generation of semi-mature
tolDCs by repressing DCs activation) as well as the succedent effectors’ and memory cells’ egress from
efferent lymphatic. Briefly, such intervention measures include: 1) multifarious immunosuppressive drugs
or molecules to generate heterogeneous tolDCs in vivo, such as ethyl pyruvate, acetylsalicylic acid,
glucocorticoid, vitamin D3, cyclosporin, rapamycin, fingolimod[268], [275]; 2) chemokine receptor blockade
or downregulation via administration of mAb and transcriptional interference agents, such as CCR5 mAb
and IFN-β1b[168], [269], [272], [273].
For instance, fingolimod, a manufactured analogue of sphingosine and a functional antagonist at all S1PRs,
could block S1P- S1PR1–5 system-mediated DCs chemotactic migration to LNs and modulate the
redistribution of lymphocytes by restricting the egress of T cells from thymus and lymph nodes[39], [40],
[277]. And a phase III clinical trial displayed that oral fingolimod (FTY7200) could hinder DCs maturation
and migration, thus, abating the annualized relapse rate in 2 years[268]. Moreover, hydroxychloroquine and
chloroquine, which are serendipitously and empirically for various rheumatic diseases treatment, could
restrain DCs mature and CTLs priming in SLOs and abused tissues though hampering TLR signals
transmission and competent cytokines secretion of stimulated DCs[274]. In addition, classical IFN-β1b
therapy against relapsing multiple sclerosis has been proved could obstruct significant chemokine receptor
CXCR4 mRNA transcription on mo-DCs and monocyte progenitors, hence, disturbing the CXCL12-CXCR4
axis-based inflammatory infiltration within CNS and in situ differentiation of mo-DCs[168], [269], [272].
Considering that the detection of upregulated CCR5 on CD16 + myeloid blood DC subgroup could be deemed
as a vital biomarker before the clinical diagnosis of GvHD[57], a phase II research manifested that extended
CCR5 blockade could provide an effective protection from acute and chronic GvHD after transplant
surgery[273].
Specially, Glatiramer acetate (Copaxone®, co-polymer 1) functions in an attractive and especial fashion,
which could regulate the biological phenotypes in activated DCs to manipulate mature DCs (instead of semimature tolDCs)-mediated bias or balance of Th1 (or Th17)/Th2 by engendering DCs-based
counterinflammatory Th2- partiality immune microenvironment to support Th2 differentiation rather than
morbigenous Th1 or Th17, which has been proved to reduce the number of enhancing lesions and lesion
volume as well as decrease the recurrence rate in (relapsing) multiple sclerosis populations[270]. Similarly,
a phase III trial showed that laquinimod also seemed to transform the activation mode of DCs from
Th1/Th17 inducer to relative anti-inflammatory Th2 inducer[271]. Therefore, elegantly manipulating

maturity or mature characteristics of DCs (rather than crudely inhibiting DCs activation) to re-modulate the
T cell differentiation rate of Th1(or Th17)/Th2/Treg in inflamed foci, may be a potential contributor to
impede the exacerbation of auto-inflammation associated disorders and re-build the immune homeostasis
in hosts.

5. Conclusions and prospects
As the cardinal elicitors of T-cell responses, DCs, which inherently feature multifunctional biological
properties and diversified migration modes, orchestrate immune amplification and immune tolerance in
specific humoral and cellular immunity. DCs’ in vivo positioning and migratory behavior toward SLOs or
inflamed regions, actually possess a considerable application value in vaccine design or clinical therapy
against carcinomas, infections and inflammatory disorders. This paper herein systematically reviews the
existing mechanisms and modulation strategies in laboratory as well as in clinical applications (or
researches) to regulate chemotaxis of endogenous DCs and exogenously reinfused DCs vaccines, proposes
the inadequacy or deficiency of current researches, and also presents certain suggestions for further
development or design of clinical practice in regulating DCs in vivo mobilization manner. However, up to
now, it has still not completely unveiled the complicated mechanistic understanding that in vivo manipulate
DCs diverse mobilization fashions (especially towards inflamed sites, such as TME and autoimmune foci).
Consequently, more efforts and attentions are required for more comprehensive understanding in
diversiform motility modes and modulators of DCs and their mononuclear precursors under physiological
and immunosuppressive or inflammatory pathological conditions, which may devote to a better clinical
outcome no matter under malignancies, viral/bacterial infections and chronic or acute inflammation.
Furthermore, to find a better strategy to intelligently modulate DCs’ in vivo chemotaxis behavior for various
diseases treatment or DCs-based vaccine design, there are several major issues remains unsolved. 1)
Considering mo-DCs are the most frequently-used DC subtype in preclinical researches and clinical
applications, for maximize the T-cell activation efficiency in anti-tumor treatment, how to overcome the
inherent deficiency of CCR7 expression and T cell priming in mo-DCs? 2) What is the most precise biodistribution kinetics of injected exogenous mo-DCs under different route of administration (e.g. i.v., s.c., i.n.,
i.d.)? 3) Does all the underlying mechanisms involving different DC subsets directional migration have been
revealed, especially towards SLOs specific compartment and multiple inflammatory regions? 4) How to
realize the industrialized manufacture of cDCs with better SLO-homing competence and T-cell initiation
ability, for more efficacious anti-tumor and anti-virus therapies? Similarly, how to formulate viable
protocols to manufacture tolDCs with maintained hyporesponsiveness in anti-autoimmunity therapies? 5)
How to overcome the influence of immunosuppressive landscape in TME? How to maintain the
immunomodulatory features of refused tolDCs and prevent tolDCs converting into self-reactive activated DC
species in the pro-inflammatory microenvironment filled with the inflammatory molecules in patients
suffering from autoimmune diseases? 6) How does DCs intercommunicate with either other APCs or nonAPCs (mainly somatic cells, e.g. keratinocytes and myocytes) in the localized vaccination sites? Do such

immunological intercommunications impact the immune amplification or tolerance induction?
In these regards, continued research into the detailed biological and immunological mechanisms of
diversified DC subgroups chemotaxis in pathological and physiological conditions, may contribute to
preclinical studies and clinical transformations in multiple immune-associated disorders treatment.

The complexity of neutrophils in health and disease: Focus on cancer
Silvia Carnevale,a,1 Somayehsadat Ghasemi,a,1 Anna Rigatelli,b and Sebastien Jaillona,b,*

Abstract
Neutrophils are essential soldiers of the immune response and their role have long been restricted to
their activities in defence against microbial infections and during the acute phase of the inflammatory
response. However, increasing number of investigations showed that neutrophils are endowed with plas‐
ticity and can participate in the orchestration of both innate and adaptive immune responses. Neu‐
trophils have an impact on a broad range of disorders, including infections, chronic inflammations, and
cancer. Neutrophils are present in the tumour microenvironment and have been reported to mediate
both pro-tumour and anti-tumour responses. Neutrophils can contribute to genetic instability, tumour
cell proliferation, angiogenesis and suppression of the anti-tumour immune response. In contrast, neu‐
trophils are reported to mediate anti-tumour resistance by direct killing of tumour cells or by engaging

trophils biology and functions in health and diseases, with a specific focus on their role in cancer biolo‐

1. Introduction
Neutrophils are the essential players in the early response against pathogens and during acute inflamma‐
tion [1,2]. In response to injury and inflammatory stimuli, neutrophils are rapidly recruited in the tis‐
sues [3] where they engage multiple cross-talks with immune and non-immune cells [4]. Accordingly,
neutrophils play an important role in the regulation of innate and adaptive immune responses and are
part of the pathogenesis of numerous diseases [2]. In addition, a growing number of studies showed that
neutrophils are endowed with plasticity and heterogeneity which have long been underestimated [[5],
[6], [7], [8]].
Cancer-related inflammation has emerged as a hallmark of tumour biology [9,10] and the tumour mi‐
croenvironment (TME) consists of both stromal and inflammatory cells, including neutrophils [11]. The
role of neutrophils in tumour biology has long been underestimated while particular emphasis has been
placed on the role of other myeloid cells, such as macrophages [12,13]. However, recent findings
showed that neutrophils are an important component of the TME and have highlighted their importance
in tumour progression as well as in the orchestration of pathways leading to tumour resistance [[14],
[15], [16], [17], [18]]. These contrasting findings are likely the results of the previously underestimated
plasticity and heterogeneity of neutrophils in cancer [8,16,19]. In humans, the density of tumour-associ‐
ated neutrophils (TANs) can have prognostic significance for patient’s outcome [[20], [21], [22], [23]].
Here we review the current understandings on neutrophils biology from their development to the mech‐
anisms of their traﬃcking and functions in health and disease, with a focus on their role in tumour biol‐
ogy and their prognostic significance in human cancer.

2. Neutrophil development and mobilization in steady state
2.1. Neutrophil development
Neutrophils have a short lifespan and their presence in the circulation requires a continuous production
in the bone marrow (BM), which is mainly regulated by the production of granulocyte-colony stimulat‐
ing factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) [1,[24], [25],
11

[26]]. In humans, up to 2 × 1011 neutrophils are produced daily during the process of granulopoiesis in
the BM and released in the bloodstream [1]. The process of granulopoiesis has been extensively studied
under both steady state and emergency conditions [25,27,28].
In the BM, hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) diﬀerentiate into lymphoid-primed multipotent progenitors
(LMPPs) or common myeloid progenitors (CMPs) which can both give rise to granulocyte monocyte
progenitors (GMPs). GMPs will commit to the generation of neutrophils upon receiving G-CSF and
GM-CSF signals produced by bone marrow stromal cells [15,26,29]. Accordingly, G-CSF−/− and GMCSF-/- mice present a severe and chronic neutropenia [30]. The process of granulopoiesis is regulated
by the successive expression of specific transcription factors (TF) and deficiency in these TFs in mice
has been associated with neutropenia [[31], [32], [33], [34], [35]]. In particular, CCAAT/enhancerbinding proteins (C/EBPs) are a family of six TFs among which the members C/EBPα, C/EBPβ and
C/EBPε are involved in neutrophil development [[36], [37], [38], [39]]. Specifically, C/EBPα acts at the
GMP stage of the process and its disruption in mice lead to a complete loss of mature neutrophils by
blocking the transition from CMPs to GMPs [40]. C/EBPβ is not necessary for the development of neu‐
trophils in steady state but plays an important role in emergency granulopoiesis (see below) [36,37]. On
the other hand, C/EBPε drives GMP to myelocyte transition and may be important in the terminal step
of the granulopoiesis [31,41]. Other TFs, such as the growth factor independent-1 (Gfi-1) have also
been implicated in the process of granulopoiesis [33,42].
Transcription factors control gene expression profiles, that define the molecular signatures of immature
cell subsets revealing their heterogeneity [36,43]. State of the art technologies, such as total and singlecell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) and mass cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF), have been employed
to characterize neutrophil diﬀerentiation and distinct cellular phenotypes have been identified from
GMP to mature neutrophils [[43], [44], [45], [46]]. In particular, a population of proliferative Gr1+
CD11b+ CXCR4hi CD117int CXCR2− neutrophil precursors (defined as preNeu) with a potential to dif‐
ferentiate into non-proliferative immature and then mature neutrophils has been identified in mouse BM
[47]. Recently, progenitors of the preNeu population have been described as early committed neutrophil
progenitors (proNeu1), which gives rise to an intermediate progeny (proNeu2) and then to the subse‐
quent populations [48]. These neutrophils progenitors are present in mice and humans and their pheno‐
typic characteristics are outlined in Table 1 . A study previously described an early unipotent neutrophil
progenitor (defined as NeP), comprising diﬀerent clusters of cells [46]. It is conceivable that this het‐
erogenous population represents a mixture of neutrophil progenitors described as proNeu1, proNeu2
and preNeu [[46], [47], [48]].

The release of neutrophils in the bloodstream is a process controlled by the regulation of the expression
of genes coding for CXCR4 and CXCR2 in neutrophil precursors [49]. In steady state, CXCL12 is con‐
stitutively expressed by BM stromal cells which supports the retention of CXCR4+ neutrophils inside
the BM. During their maturation, expression of CXCR4 on the surface of neutrophils is downregulated,
while the expression of CXCR2 is increased, leading to their release in the blood via the interaction
with CXC chemokines (e.g. CXCL1, CXCL2) present in the circulation [15,24,49,50]. Circulating aged
neutrophils upregulate the expression of CXCR4 in order to migrate into the BM where they are elimi‐
nated by macrophages [51].

3. Neutrophil development and mobilization during inflammation
In steady state, BM is the unique site of haematopoiesis, but during inflammatory conditions, such as
cancer and systemic infection, the spleen can be involved in the generation of neutrophils [52,53]. In
inflammatory conditions, expression levels of granulopoietic cytokines, such as G-CSF, GM-CSF and
IL-6 are increased, leading to the process of emergency granulopoiesis [27,54]. Interestingly, despite
that G-CSF−/− and GM-CSF-/- mice present a severe neutropenia in steady state, the expression of IL-6
in these mice can be suﬃcient for the production of neutrophils during emergency granulopoiesis
[15,30]. However, the phenotype and eﬀector functions of neutrophils produced in G-CSF−/− and GMCSF-/- mice remain to be fully elucidated.
Neutrophil development during inflammation is also controlled by the expression of specific transcrip‐
tion factors [37,55,56]. Increased expression of G-CSF and G-CSF receptor signalling triggers the
phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) which directly enhances
C/EBPβ expression in progenitor cells [27]. In a negative feedback loop, the phosphorylation of STAT3
activates the suppressor of cytokine signalling3 (SOCS3), which in turn, by inhibiting the activation of
STAT3, prevents an excessive production of neutrophils [27].
Elevated number of circulating neutrophils have been reported in inflammatory conditions, including
cancer [7,57,58]. Accordingly, the production of cytokines and chemokines (such as Il-17, IL-1β, GCSF, CXCL1, CXCL2) involved in the development and mobilization of neutrophils is upregulated in
tumour-bearing host [15]. Tumour cells themselves or tumour-associated immune cells can produce
these cytokines. For instance, tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) produce IL-1β, which stimu‐
lates T cells to produce IL-17. In turn, IL-17 increases the expression of G-CSF and the release of neu‐
trophils in the circulation (see also the paragraph 6.2) [15]. The pressure created by the tumours on neu‐
trophil mobilization can lead to the release of immature neutrophils in the circulation [8,14,59]. In
mouse models of cancer, the frequency of Ly6Ghigh CD101− immature neutrophils in the blood has
been positively correlated with the tumour burden [47]. In both human and mice, NePs (see above), are
reported to infiltrate the tumour tissue [14,46,47,60]. In particular, NePs have been identified in the
blood and tumour of melanoma patients and reported to promote tumour growth in mice through their
immunosuppressive activities (see below) [46]. Studies described pro-tumoral capacity for immature

The complexity of neutrophils in health and disease: Focus on cancer - PMC

neutrophils through their T-cell suppression ability [14,61]. However, not all immature neutrophils
show immunosuppressive proprieties [62,63] and further investigations are needed to fully understand
the exact mechanism in which these cells aﬀect tumour growth.

4. Neutrophil recruitment in tissues
Once in the circulation, neutrophils are ready to migrate into the tissues [3]. Diﬀerent conditions pro‐
vide chemotactic gradients for neutrophil recruitment. In particular, Neutrophils express the chemokine
receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2 and the presence of their ligands provides important chemotactic path‐
ways for neutrophil recruitment to the tissues [64,65].
Extravasation of neutrophils across the vascular endothelium is a multistep process orchestrated by ad‐
hesion molecules present on vascular endothelial cells and neutrophils. This process has been exten‐
sively studied and involves the following steps: capture, rolling, arrest, firm adhesion and transmigra‐
tion [1]. Neutrophil capture and rolling on endothelium occur through the initial interaction of P-se‐
lectin glycoprotein ligand 1 (PSGL1) expressed on neutrophils with P-selectin and E-selectin expressed
on endothelial cells. In addition, engagement of L-selectin expressed by neutrophils with sialylated lig‐
ands on endothelial cells is also involved in the rolling of neutrophils and activation of integrins
[66,67]. Lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1) is the principal integrin which mediates
arrest and firm adhesion of rolling neutrophils. LFA-1 binds to its ligands intercellular adhesion mol‐
ecule 1 (ICAM1) and ICAM2 expressed on the endothelium [68]. Once arrested on the endothelium,
neutrophils are ready to transmigrate from the vasculature to the tissue where they can play diﬀerent
roles depending on the tissue context or inflammatory situation (see below).
In addition to their migration in tissues, evidences showed that neutrophils can migrate from the in‐
flamed tissues to the circulation through the process of reverse migration, which has been associated
with the disruption of endothelial cells tight junctions and an altered production of chemoattractant
molecules [[69], [70], [71]]. The process of reverse migration has been proposed to prevent excessive
inflammation and tissue damage through the removal of neutrophils but could also act as a trigger of
inflammation in a secondary site through the migration of activated neutrophils [70,72]. Therefore,
while neutrophil traﬃcking to inflamed tissues has been extensively studied, the mechanism and role of
reverse migration remain poorly understood and future investigations are needed to decipher the diﬀer‐
ent aspects of this process.

4.1. Neutrophil recruitment in cancer
As mentioned above, neutrophils express CXCR1 and CXCR2, which can bind to their ligands CXCL1,
CXCL2, CXCL5, CXCL6, and CXCL8 released by tumour cells, stromal cells and leukocytes in the
TME [50,73]. In addition to chemokines, tumour cells and tumour-infiltrating leukocytes are reported
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7500440/

Page 6 of 36

The complexity of neutrophils in health and disease: Focus on cancer - PMC

2/19/24, 11:00 AM

to produce cytokines involved in the development, mobilization and recruitment of neutrophils. For in‐
stance, T cells are shown to produce GM-CSF, TNFα, IL-17, CXCL1 and CXCL2, which can directly
or indirectly recruit neutrophils to the TME [14,15,[74], [75], [76]]. Tumour-associated neutrophils
(TANs) themselves produce CXCL1 and CXCL2, which in turn enhance their recruitment in the TME
[77]. In diﬀerent models of primary carcinogenesis, deficiency in CXCR2 has been associated with a
dramatic reduction of neutrophil recruitment in the TME associated with reduction in tumour growth
[78,79]. In addition to chemokines, tumour-derived oxysterols are also shown to trigger the recruitment
of neutrophils to the TME through a CXCR2 dependent mechanism [80].
Recent investigations showed that neutrophils were present in the TME at the very early stages of tu‐
mour growth. Indeed, intravital multiphoton imaging in transplantable tumour models of mice with
neutrophil-specific fluorescence revealed that neutrophils were present in the TME as early as 3 h after
tumour cell injection and were present in the tissue up to 3 days after tumour cell injection [81]. Here,
intra-tumoral neutrophils showed lower motility compared to peri-tumoral neutrophils, suggesting that
the TME can aﬀect neutrophil motility and functions [81].

5. Neutrophil functions
5.1. The role of neutrophils in steady state
The classical view of neutrophil roles has long been limited to their eﬀector functions in the elimination
of pathogens. However, a growing body of evidence showed the recruitment of neutrophils into naive
tissues and their role in maintaining tissue homeostasis, such as in the lung where pulmonary endotheli‐
um retains CXCR4+ neutrophils through the expression of CXCL12 [3,82,83]. Under homeostatic con‐
dition, neutrophils are also found in liver, spleen and lymph nodes where they play diﬀerent roles
[3,84,85]. Indeed, liver infiltrating neutrophils can participate in lipid metabolism [84], whereas neu‐
trophils present in the spleen provide helper signals to B cells through the production of B-cell activat‐
ing factor (BAFF), a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) and IL-21 [85]. In lymph nodes, neu‐
trophils are mostly located in proximity of T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. These neutrophils ex‐
press high amount of major histocompatibility complex II (MHCII), suggesting a role in CD4+ T cell
activation [86].
Neutrophils have been also detected in other tissues, such as intestine, white adipose tissue, skin, and
skeletal muscle but their role remains to be elucidated [3].

5.2. The role of neutrophils in infections

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7500440/

2/19/24, 11:00 AM

Neutrophils can detect a wide range of ligands expressed by microbes through their broad repertoire of
cell associated and soluble pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and represent the first line of defence
against invading pathogens [2,29,87]. Neutrophils can eliminate pathogens through phagocytosis and
production of ROS into the phagocytic vacuole, discharge of cytoplasmic granules containing microbi‐
cidal components, release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), or indirectly by secreting pro-in‐
flammatory cytokines and chemokines (e.g. TNFα, IL-6, IL-1β and IL-8) [2,88,89], which promote the
recruitment and activation of other immune cells [[90], [91], [92], [93]].
In addition to their role in defence against pathogens, NETs are reported to drive thrombosis [93,94]. In
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, increased plasma levels of NETs were correlated with
the disease severity and in autopsy lung samples from patients, neutrophils undergoing NETosis were
shown to colocalize with platelets in structures consistent with blood vessels, suggesting the role of
NETs in COVID-19 related thrombosis [95]. These results suggest NETs formation as a potential target
for COVID-19 treatment. In a more general view, these results highlight that an excessive presence of
activated neutrophils in tissues can be deleterious for the host [96,97]. Thus, an eﬃcient resolution of
inflammation is crucial for the restoration of tissue integrity and function after an infection. Neutrophils
are actively involved in this process through the production of pro-resolving lipid mediators (including
resolvins and protectin D1). These molecules can block the infiltration of neutrophils in tissues and
contribute to chemokines and cytokines scavenging [2,98,99]. In addition, phagocytosis of apoptotic
neutrophils changes the phenotype of macrophages to produce anti-inflammatory cytokines such as
TGFβ and IL-10 [100].

5.3. The role of neutrophils in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases
A growing number of studies showed that neutrophils can be involved in diﬀerent inflammatory and
autoimmune diseases, such as in cardiovascular disorders, multiple sclerosis (MS), systemic lupus ery‐
thematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) [2,[101], [102], [103], [104]].
Proteins stored in neutrophils granules, such as MPO and LL-37 have been associated with the process
of atherosclerosis through the activation of endothelial cells and the recruitment of inflammatory mono‐
cytes, respectively [105,106]. NETs have also been associated with cardiovascular diseases through dif‐
ferent mechanisms, including activation of endothelial cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and
macrophages [107,108]. Accordingly, neutrophil depletion in mice decreased the number of monocytes
in aortic lysates and reduced the plaque sizes [109].
Neutrophils have also been involved in autoimmune diseases [104]. For instance, a population of low
density neutrophils producing pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IFNα, TNFα) and NETs has been iden‐
tified in SLE patients [110]. Impaired clearance of apoptotic neutrophils by macrophages is also ob‐

served in these patients [111]. Interestingly, NETs can activate pDCs, which in turn produce IFNα and
IL-6 to promote B cell diﬀerentiation into plasma cells [112,113]. Neutrophils can also support the B
cell response through the production of BAFF [114,115].
Collectively, these data suggest that neutrophils, neutrophil-derived molecules and NETs represent im‐
portant targets for therapy in patients with inflammatory and autoimmune disorders.

6. Neutrophil heterogeneity
6.1. Neutrophils heterogeneity in steady state
In steady state, both circulating and tissue neutrophils are endowed with functional and phenotypic
characteristics [16,116]. Accordingly, neutrophil heterogeneity has been associated with diﬀerent para‐
meters, such as maturation, ageing or activation states in response to signals from the tissue microenvi‐
ronment, such as cytokines [19].
The BM is the principal site of granulopoiesis and elimination of aged neutrophils. Interestingly, in vivo
studies revealed specialized subsets of neutrophils in the BM displaying niche-supportive and HSCsupportive functions. In particular, a subset of granulocytes expressing the histidine-decarboxylase and
histamine was shown to support the quiescence of myeloid-biased HSCs [117]. Moreover, BM neu‐
trophils can secrete prostaglandin E2 which promotes the retention of HSC in the BM through the pro‐
duction of osteopontin by the preosteoblasts [118].
Neutrophils are released in the blood following a circadian rhythm and circulating neutrophils present
diﬀerent phenotypes over the course of the day in both humans and mice [19,51,119,120]. In particular,
mature neutrophils freshly released from the BM are described as CD62L+ and CXCR2+ neutrophils.
Within ∼6 h in the circulation, neutrophils downregulate the expression of CD62 L and upregulate the
expression of CXCR4 and CD11b and acquire a hypersegmented nuclei. These CXCR4+ CD11b+
CD62Llow neutrophils exhibit increased integrin activation and a significant capacity to form NETs in
inflamed mouse venules [119,121]. These phenotypic changes were linked to a circadian transcriptional
oscillation of the transcription factor BMAL1 which controls the expression of CXCL2 by neutrophils.
In turn, CXCL2 acts on CXCR2 to drive neutrophil ageing [119].

6.2. Neutrophils heterogeneity in cancer
Heterogeneity and plasticity of tumour infiltrating leukocytes (TILs) have been well characterized.
Macrophages served as a paradigm for this phenomenon with classically activated M1 macrophages
and alternatively activated M2 macrophages exerting anti-tumour and pro-tumour activities, respective‐
ly [13,122]. TANs can also undergo two diﬀerent polarization states and by analogy with the nomencla‐
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7500440/

The complexity of neutrophils in health and disease: Focus on cancer - PMC

2/19/24, 11:00 AM

ture of M1 and M2 macrophages, TANs are classified into anti-tumour N1 neutrophils and pro-tumour
N2 neutrophils. Here, TGFβ presents in the TME drives the polarization towards the N2 phenotype
[44]. N1 TANs have been characterized by their cytotoxic activity towards tumour cells, their capacity
to produce T cell chemokines CCL3, CXCL9 and CXCL10 and to sustain CD8+ T cells activation [77].
In contrast, N2 TANs showed a pro-tumour phenotype characterized by the release of proangiogenic
factors (e.g. matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9)) and the inhibition of CD8+ T cells activation through
secretion of arginase 1 (Arg1) [44,77].
Neutrophil diﬀerentiation and maturation trajectories are profoundly altered in tumour-bearing mice
[57,123]. In advanced neoplasia, immature myeloid cells endowed with immunosuppressive properties
appear in the circulation, primary tumours and metastases, often referred to as monocytes or granulo‐
cytes-myeloid-derived suppressor cells (M-MDSCs or G-MDSCs) [46,124,125]. G-MDSCs are func‐
tionally characterized by their ability to suppress T cells proliferation and activation ex vivo [126].
However, there is no consensus regarding their phenotypic characterization based on surface molecule
expression. In human, G-MDSCs are described as CD15+ CD66b+ CD33dim HLA-DR− rendering them
indistinguishable from the other neutrophil subsets [127,128].
Besides their heterogeneity in gene expression profile and surface molecule expression, neutrophils
were classified by their sedimentation proprieties into low density neutrophils (LDNs), normal density
neutrophils (NDNs) and high density neutrophil (HDNs) [16,17,129]. LDNs were reported to include
both immature and mature neutrophils and to accumulate in cancer [8]. LDNs were described to be
generally endowed with immunosuppressive proprieties [8,22,130]. However, immunosuppressive neu‐
trophils (CD66b+, CD10+) have been also observed in the HDN fraction [131], highlighting the urge
for an accurate system to define the neutrophil subsets in cancer.

7. The role of neutrophils in cancer
7.1. Interactions between neutrophils and tumour cells in the primary tumour
Cancer-related inflammation has emerged as a hallmark of cancer [9,10] and neutrophils were found to
infiltrate diﬀerent types of neoplasia, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), colorectal cancer
(CRC), gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, melanoma, breast cancer and renal carcinoma [15,16,
[20], [21], [22],132].
In the TME, neutrophils represent a source of cytokines, chemokines and growth factors that sustain
tumour growth and progression including epidermal growth factor (EGF), hepatocytes growth factor
(HGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) [16,133]. Other neutrophil-derived mediators that
influence tumour progression are found in neutrophil granules. For instance, NE has been shown to
favour the proliferation of diﬀerent cancer cell types in vitro, such as human oesophageal cell lines and

mammary cell lines through the transactivation of the EGF receptor (EGFR) and TLR4, and human
prostate cancer cell lines through the activation of the mitogen activation protein kinase (MAPK) path‐
way [[134], [135], [136]]. In a genetically engineered mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma induced by
oncogenic Kras, NE-deficient mice displayed reduced tumour cells proliferation and tumour growth.
Mechanistically, in vitro experiments showed that NE acted by degrading the insulin receptor substrate
1 (IRS-1), which usually inhibits the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) in tumour cells. In turn, PI3K
can interact with the cytoplasmic domain of the PDGFR, which has a potent mitogenic action on hu‐
man and mouse lung cancer cells [137] (Fig. 1 ).

Fig. 1
The pro-tumour activities of neutrophils.
a) Neutrophils can express ligands of immune checkpoints expressed on T cells, such as PD-L1. In response to TGFβ,
neutrophils produce Arg1, leading to T cell dysfunction and suppression of the T cell-mediated anti-tumour response.
b) Neutrophil-derived mediators, such as Bv8, MMP9, S100A8, S100A9, and NETs play an important role in the for‐
mation of metastasis through diﬀerent mechanisms, such as tumour angiogenesis or entrapment and migration of circu‐
lating cancer cells. c) Neutrophil-derived ROS sustain DNA damage and genetic instability in epithelial cells; d) Neu‐
trophils elastase (NE) and neutrophil-derived growth factors (i.e. EGF, HGF, PDGF) sustain the proliferation of tumour
cells. e) Tumour cells drive the production of IL-1β in macrophages, which in turn activates the expression of IL-17 in
γδ T cell, leading to the activation of the IL-17/G-CSF pathway and the recruitment of immunosuppressive neutrophils
in the pre-metastatic lungs.

In addition to their role against microbial infections, NETs were observed in diﬀerent tumours (e.g. liv‐
er, breast and intestinal) and were associated with the presence of metastasis (see below) [[138], [139],
[140], [141], [142], [143]]. A recent study showed that NETs were able to interfere with lymphocytes
cytotoxicity in the primary tumour. in vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrated that NETs can form a
protective layer on tumour cells that acts as a shield against the cytotoxic activity of CD8+ T cells and
NK cells (Fig. 1). Interestingly, pharmacological inhibition of NETs synergized with combination im‐
munotherapy of anti-PD1 plus anti-CTLA4 to delay tumour progression in mice injected with 4T1
breast cancer cell line [144].
In tumour, neutrophil-derived ROS have been associated with increased DNA damage and genetic in‐
stability in epithelial cells [145] suggesting that neutrophils were involved in the initiation stage of car‐
cinogenesis (Fig. 1). Accordingly, neutropenic mice (Csf3−/− mice) showed reduced urethane-induced
lung carcinogenesis and forcing the recruitment of neutrophils in Csf3−/− mice by G-CSF was suﬃcient
to restore tumour formation in the lung. The detrimental activity of neutrophils was linked to the pro‐
duction of ROS, which acts as an amplifier of DNA damage induced by urethane carcinogenesis [146].
In apparent contrast, in 3-methylcholathrene(3-MCA)-induced sarcomagenesis, neutrophils were found
to be crucial for the initiation of an early anti-tumour response. Indeed, neutrophils amplified the pro‐
duction of IL-12 in macrophages, which induced type 1 polarization and IFNγ production in a subset of
unconventional T cell (CD4- CD8- TCRβ+) [17]. These contrasting reports are likely related to the
plasticity and heterogeneity of neutrophils in diﬀerent tissue contexts and conditions.
ROS were shown to be a potent arm for neutrophil anti-tumour activity, through which they can directly
kill tumour cells [44,147]. in vivo evidences showed that neutrophils can kill tumour cells through a
cell-contact dependent mechanism and the generation of ROS (i.e. H2O2). Cancer cells undergoing ep‐
ithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) upregulated the transient receptor potential cation channel, sub‐
family M, member 2 (TRPM2), an H2O2-dependent Ca2+ channel, which induces a lethal influx of
Ca2+ in target cells [148] (Fig. 2 ). Accordingly, reduced TRPM2 expression in cancer cells protected
them from the cytotoxic activity of neutrophils. Moreover, the expression of TRPM2 is associated with
increased release of CXCL2, a potent neutrophil chemoattractant. These data suggest that TRPM2 has a
dual role in tumour, by promoting the recruitment of neutrophils in the TME and the elimination of
cancer cells [149].

The anti-tumour activities of neutrophils.
a) Neutrophils enhance the expression of IL-12 by macrophages, which leads to the polarization of UTCαβ towards a
type 1 activation state with increased expression of Tbet and IFNγ. b) Neutrophils can kill tumour cells through the
release of ROS (i.e. H2O2) or RNI (NO) induced by various stimuli. c) In response to IL-1β, neutrophils restrict the
invasion of bacteria and the subsequent tumour-promoting inflammation. d) In response to GM-CSF and IFNγ, imma‐
ture neutrophils acquire an APC-like phenotype and can activate CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.

Neutrophil-mediated killing of tumour cells can also be induced by the expression of TNF-related
apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) by neutrophils [150] and TNFα. Tumour cell-derived TNFα in‐
duced the expression of the hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGFR, also called MET) in neutrophils
[151]. This induction is crucial for neutrophil transmigration through inflamed endothelium, the pro‐
duction of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and NO by neutrophils in response to HGF. In turn,
NO kills cancer cells [151] (Fig. 2). In contrast, the HGF-MET pathway was also shown to drive an
immunosuppressive phenotype in neutrophils associated with limited expansion of anti-tumour T cells
[152]. Therefore, the impact of MET expression on neutrophils and its possible therapeutic applications
is still to be fully clarified.

7.2. The role of neutrophils in metastasis

The accumulation of neutrophils in tissues distant from the primary tumour has been shown to con‐
tribute to the formation of the pre-metastatic niche. In the pre-metastatic lung, neutrophils were found
to promote the formation of metastasis via the secretion of several mediators, such as the proangiogenic
factors Bv8 (also called prokineticin 2) and MMP-9 [76], the chemoattractant molecules S100A8 and
S100A9 [14], NE and cathepsin G that mediate the degradation of thrombospondin-1 (Tsp-1) [153], the
pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β and the leukotriene B4 (LTB4) [18]. In particular, neutrophil-derived
MMP-9 was shown to induce the liberation and the activation of VEGF and the subsequent production
of new vessels. in vivo studies have shown that Bv8, produced by neutrophils, was responsible for the
poor eﬃcacy of anti-VEGF therapy. Thus, the inhibition of IL-17\G-CSF axis was shown to increase
the therapeutic eﬃcacy of anti-VEGF treatment [[154], [155], [156], [157]].
The use of oncogene-driven cancer model has highlighted how the interaction between tumour cells
and neutrophils was involved in metastasis formation [14,18,158,159]. In K14cre; Cdh1fl/fl; Trp53fl/fl
(KEP) mouse model of breast cancer, the accumulation of neutrophils in the pre-metastatic lung with
immunosuppressive features was associated with the formation of lung metastasis [14]. Further studies
have demonstrated that tumour cells, through the secretion of WNT ligands induced a systemic pro-in‐
flammatory cascade starting by the secretion of IL-1β by macrophages [159]. In turn, IL-1β induced the
production of IL-17 by γδ T cells, leading to a G-CSF-dependent expansion of neutrophils and their
polarization in an immunosuppressive phenotype [14,160] (Fig. 1). Accordingly, IL-17 derived from
CD4 + T cells or γδ T cells drives most of the neutrophils-derived pro-tumour activities described
above.
Studies showed that NETs can support the formation of metastasis through their ability to trap dissemi‐
nating cancer cells and to facilitate their seeding and proliferation in a distant anatomical site [[138],
[139], [140], [141], [142], [143]]. In an in vivo model of lung metastasis, sustained lung inflammation
and cancer cell-derived G-CSF induced NETs formation, which in turn promoted the proliferation of
dormant cancer cells. Accordingly, administration of DNase to eliminate NETs reduced the formation
of lung metastasis [142]. In ovarian cancer, the formation of new metastasis in the omentum was also
dependent on the formation of NETs in the pre-metastatic niche [141]. Mechanistically, recent investi‐
gations have provided new insights regarding the molecular interaction between cancer cells and NETs.
In particular, cancer cells express the coiled-coil domain containing protein-25 (CCDC25), which acts
as an extracellular DNA sensor and can activate cell motility [161]. Therefore, the formation of NETs
in the liver or lung induced the migration of cancer cells and CCDC25-deficient mice present a reduced
formation of metastasis. Moreover, in silico analyses showed that CCDC25 was expressed by several
cancer cells in human and in cohorts of patients with breast cancer or colon cancer, the expression of
CCDC25 was correlated with poor clinical outcome [161].
In apparent contrast with the previous findings, neutrophils recruitment and activation in the metastatic
niche was found to be important for the reduction of metastasis formation through the killing of cancer
cells [162,163]. Genetic ablation of the atypical chemokine receptor 2 (ACKR2) resulted in increased

levels of chemokine receptors (i.e. CCR1, CCR2 and CCR5) in hematopoietic progenitors and the re‐
lease from the BM of activated neutrophils endowed with cytotoxic activity towards tumour cells and
anti-metastatic potential [163]. ACKR2 deficient mice transplanted with 4T1 breast cancer cell lines or
intravenously injected with B16F10 melanoma cell lines showed protection against metastasis forma‐
tion [163]. Thus, targeting ACKR2 unleashed anti-metastatic potential of neutrophils and represents an
interesting novel myeloid checkpoint for innovative therapeutic strategies.
A recent study has demonstrated a mechanism that may explain, at least in part, why breast cancer pa‐
tients develop metastasis [162]. The injection of human breast cancer cells with low spontaneous
metastatic potential in non-obese diabetic (NOD)/severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice, re‐
sulted in reprogramming of neutrophils in the pre-metastatic lung. Breast cancer cells with low sponta‐
neous metastatic potential secreted high amount of CCL2 compared to cancer cells with high metastatic
potential. CCL2 induced the recruitment of IFNγ-producing CCR2+ monocytes in the pre-metastatic
lung, leading to upregulation of the transmembrane protein 173 (TMEM173, also called STING) on
neutrophils and activation of their cytotoxic activity [162].
Collectively, these studies underlined the relevance of neutrophils in the TME, both in the primary site
and in the metastatic niche. Neutrophils with pro-tumour activities are associated to all steps of tumori‐
genesis, from the promotion of genetic instability, through the proliferation, dissemination and implan‐
tation of cancer cells to distal anatomical sites. However, when properly activated, neutrophils can kill
tumour cells and participate to the anti-tumour response. Thus, studies aimed at clarifying the pathways
that trigger neutrophils cytotoxicity against cancer cells, may be useful to pave the way for new thera‐
peutic strategies targeting neutrophils.

7.3. The interaction between neutrophils and immune cells in cancer
Once recruited into inflamed tissues, neutrophils can engage bi-directional interactions with non-im‐
mune (e.g. platelets, mesenchymal cells) or immune cells (e.g. DCs, macrophages, NK cells, B cells, T
cells) [2]. These interactions can occur in a contact-depend manner or via the secretion of soluble medi‐
ators. In these cross-talks, neutrophils receive signals that modulate their survival or activation status,
while on the other hand neutrophils amplify, suppress or initiate the innate and adaptive immune re‐
sponses [4,16]. These interactions have been shown to be relevant in the TME. For instance, tumourentrained neutrophils can produce chemokines, including CXCL10, CCL2, CCL3, CXCL1 and CX‐
CL2, responsible for the recruitment of T cells and other leukocytes [2,16].
In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), phenotypic analysis of neutrophils in early stage patients re‐
vealed that neutrophils can acquire antigen presenting cell (APC)-like features and activate CD4+ T
cells and CD8+ T cells [60]. These APC-like neutrophils derived from a subset of immature progenitors
(CD11b+ CD15hi CD10– CD16int/low) that in response to GM-CSF and IFNγ present in the TME in‐

creased the expression of MHCII and CD86 (Fig. 2). On the same line, neutrophils isolated from col‐
orectal cancer (CRC) patients were able to enhance CD8+ T cell responsiveness to T cell receptor
(TCR) triggering [164].
Neutrophils have been described to be important in orchestrating the establishment of an eﬀective antitumour immunity in sarcoma [17]. In a model of 3-MCA-induced sarcoma, neutrophils were found to
engage a tripartite interaction with macrophages and a subset of UTCαβ. Neutrophils, by amplifying the
production of IL-12 by macrophages, were essential to promote type I polarization and IFNγ produc‐
tion in UTCαβ, which support tumour resistance in vivo (Fig. 2). Interestingly, in silico analyses indicat‐
ed that this neutrophil dependent anti-tumour axis was relevant in selected human tumours, including
undiﬀerentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS), CRC and ovarian cancer [17].
As mentioned above, neutrophils in the TME can produce diﬀerent mediators including ROS, reactive
nitrogen intermediates (RNI) and Arg1 involved in the suppression of both innate and adaptive immune
cells eﬀector functions. In a mammary transplantable tumour model, c-Kit+ immature neutrophils were
shown to be sensitive to glucose limitation. In this condition, neutrophils use mitochondrial fatty acid
oxidation to support NAPDH oxidase-dependent ROS production which inhibits the T cells response
[165]. This mitochondrial fitness is driven by c-Kit and was especially observed in splenic neutrophils
[165].
In response to TGFβ found in TME, neutrophils produced high amount of Arg1, which reduced the
availability of L-arginine in the TME and lead to T cell dysfunction and suppression of the T cell-medi‐
ated anti-tumour response [44] (Fig. 1). Notably, Arg1 produced by neutrophils from renal carcinoma
and NSCLC cancer patients inhibited T cell response [166,167].
Recent investigations showed an interaction between neutrophils and the microbiota in cancer [160,
[168], [169], [170], [171]]. Microbiota can regulate the granulopoiesis through the activation of the IL17/G-CSF pathway in the intestine [172]. In CRC, neutrophils were reported to have a tumour suppres‐
sive eﬀect through the expression of antimicrobial peptides, which limit the invasion of bacteria and the
subsequent tumour-promoting inflammation [[168], [169], [170]] (Fig. 2). In addition, the process of
lung carcinogenesis induced by Kras mutation coupled with p53 loss has been described to be associat‐
ed with dysbiosis of the airway microbiota, which stimulates IL-17 production by resident γδ T cells
resulting in neutrophilia and tumour growth [160].
Neutrophils engage important bi-directional interactions also with innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), partic‐
ularly with NK cells. For instance, neutrophils have been shown to promote the metastatic spread by
preventing NK cells-mediated clearance of disseminating cancer cells [144,173]. in vivo experiments
showed that in the absence of NK cells, neutrophils acquired a pro-tumour phenotype characterized by
increased expression of VEGF-A [174]. These results suggest that NK cells can control neutrophils protumour activities.

Neutrophils can express ligands of checkpoint receptors, such as PD-L1 and V-domain immunoglobulin
suppressor of T-cell activation (VISTA) involved in the suppression of the T cell response by driving
checkpoint engagement and T cell exhaustion (Fig. 1). PD-L1 expressing neutrophils were found in he‐
patocellular carcinoma and gastric cancer and were associated with a bad prognosis [175,176]. In a
murine transplantable model of melanoma, blockade of VISTA induced the production of IL-12 in tu‐
mour associated monocytes and dendritic cells, via a MyD88-dependent pro-inflammatory response
[177]. However, the inhibition of VISTA on neutrophils did not alter their immunosuppressive pheno‐
type, suggesting that combination therapy, with VISTA inhibition and reprogramming or depletion of
neutrophils, should be considered in this model.
Collectively, these findings suggest that neutrophils can amplify or suppress the immune anti-tumour
immune response, through diﬀerent mechanisms. Deciphering these mechanisms may provide new
therapeutic approaches to reprogram neutrophils in an anti-tumour activation state.

8. Clinical significance of neutrophils in cancer patients
8.1. Prognostic significance of neutrophils in cancer patients
High density of TANs or a high level of absolute neutrophil count (ANC) in the blood are generally
associated with a poor prognosis in cancer patients [16,[20], [21], [22]]. Accordingly, blood neutrophil
to lymphocytes ratio (NLR) has been proposed as a clinical biomarker in patients with cancer. This pa‐
rameter is easy to obtain in clinical practice and can be monitored over time. A systematic review of
electronic databases has been conducted to explore the significance of blood NLR in a variety of solid
tumours. In 40,559 patients, with 22 diﬀerent types of cancer, blood NLR was associated with faster
tumour progression and reduced overall survival (OS) of patients in the majority of solid tumours [23].
However, it is important to note that the validity of the NLR parameter has been questioned. Indeed,
NLR is a dynamic parameter that can undergo variations over time and can be aﬀected by other clinical
parameters, such as infections. Therefore, it remains to establish an optimal and uniform threshold to
define a low, normal and high NLR in cancer patients [178].
Beside circulating neutrophils, the density of TANs has been also associated with outcome of patients
with cancer. Neutrophils represent a significant proportion of tumour-infiltrating leukocytes in diﬀerent
subtype of solid tumours, including NSCLC, hepatocellular carcinoma, renal carcinoma, CRC and gas‐
tric cancer [20,21,132,164,175,176,[179], [180], [181]]. In most cases, density of TANs has been asso‐
ciated with a bad prognosis, likely due to their immunosuppressive features and their tumour promoting
functions (see above). For example, TANs represent the dominant leukocytes population in NSCLC and
were found inversely associated with T cell infiltration [180].

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7500440/

Page 17 of 36

The complexity of neutrophils in health and disease: Focus on cancer - PMC

2/19/24, 11:00 AM

In other tumour contexts, such as in CRC, endometrial cancer, invasive ductal breast carcinoma, low
grade glioma and undiﬀerentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS), density of TANs appear to correlate
with a good prognosis [17,60,164,179,182,183]. In CRC patients, TANs were frequently colocalized
with CD8+ T cells and can enhance their responsiveness to TCR triggering [164]. In patients with UPS
neutrophil infiltration and a neutrophil signature were associated with a type I immune response and a
better prognosis [17].
Thus, currently available data on the occurrence and significance of neutrophils in human cancer sug‐
gest that circulating and tumour infiltrating neutrophils may have opposite prognostic significance in
diﬀerent tumour contexts.

8.2. Neutrophils in response to therapy
High levels of circulating neutrophils, NLR or density of TANs have been associated with a poor re‐
sponse to diﬀerent treatments, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy and immunotherapy, in the major‐
ity of solid tumours [[184], [185], [186], [187], [188], [189], [190]]. Some exception are CRC, gastric
cancer and ovarian cancer where higher levels of TANs have been associated with a good response to
therapy [179,183,[191], [192], [193], [194], [195], [196]].
For instance, high levels of CD66b+ neutrophils infiltration in stage (I-IV) CRC patients were found to
correlate with a better clinical outcome [179,183] and in a cohort of stage III CRC patients and gastric
cancer patients treated or not with 5-FU-based chemotherapy, high levels of TANs infiltration have
been associated with a better response to therapy [179,195]. Interestingly, similar findings have been
observed in patients with ovarian cancer treated with a platinum-based chemotherapy [193]. Therefore,
further investigations are needed to define the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which neutrophils
can improve the eﬃcacy of chemotherapy in specific cancer subtypes.

9. Conclusions
The role of neutrophils has long been considered restricted to the elimination of invading pathogens
and to the acute phase of inflammation. However, a large number of studies have challenged this view
and neutrophils are now recognized for their role in the activation and orientation of both the innate and
adaptive immune responses. Moreover, neutrophils are endowed with a previously underestimated plas‐
ticity and can engage complex cross-talks with immune and non-immune cells, depending on the tissue
and inflammatory contexts. Accordingly, neutrophils can participate in the pathogenesis of diﬀerent
disorders such as infections, chronic inflammation, autoimmunity and cancer.

The role of neutrophils in cancer has long been considered insignificant and was neglected. However,
neutrophilia is observed in cancer and neutrophils represent an important component of the TME.
Therefore, the clinical significance of circulating neutrophils, NLR and TANs has been proposed in hu‐
man cancer and mostly associated with a poor prognosis.
Neutrophils play a dual role in cancer and can support both pro-tumour and anti-tumour mechanisms.
Neutrophils can sustain genetic instability, tumour cell proliferation and metastasis and can suppress the
immune response. In contrast, neutrophils can kill tumour cells and can be part of the anti-tumour im‐
mune response. This dual role is probably related to the diversity and plasticity of neutrophils in diﬀer‐
ent tumour contexts, leading to the formation of diﬀerent subtypes of neutrophils with opposite func‐
tions. Therefore, a better dissection of TANs diversity in diﬀerent cancer subtypes is required to define
a comprehensive nomenclature of neutrophils in cancer and to identify the pathways that shape neu‐
trophils in an anti-tumour activation state. We assume that further therapeutic approaches targeting neu‐
trophils in cancer represent a new frontier in cancer immunotherapy.

Cannabidiol (CBD) is a phytocannabinoid that has a great clinical therapeutic potential. Few studies have
been published on its efficacy in ocular inflammations while its impact on intraocular pressure (IOP), a
major risk factor for glaucoma, remains unclear. Moreover, due to its lability and high lipophilicity, its
formulation within a prolonged stable topical ophthalmic solution or emulsion able to penetrate the highly
selective corneal barrier is challenging. Therefore, various CBD nanoemulsions (NEs) were designed and
evaluated for stability in accelerated conditions. Further, the optimal formulation was tested on a murine
LPS-induced keratitis inflammation model. Lastly, increasing CBD concentrations were topically applied, for
two weeks, on mice eyes, for IOP measurement. CBD NEs exhibited optimal physicochemical characteristics
for ocular delivery. A specific antioxidant was required to obtain the stable, final, formulation. In vivo, 0.4 to
1.6% CBD w/v reduced the levels of key inflammatory cytokines, depending on the concentration applied.
These concentrations decreased or did not affect the IOP. Our results showed that a well-designed CBD
ocular dosage form can be stabilized for an extended shelf life. Furthermore, the significant decrease in
inflammatory cytokines levels could be exploited, provided that an adequate therapeutic dosage regimen is
identified in humans.

Introduction
Inflammation is a hallmark of many prevalent ocular surface diseases such as keratitis (Torrecilla et al.,
2018), dry eye (Yu et al., 2021) and allergic conjunctivitis (Erdinest et al., 2020). In nonpathological states,
the cornea, the limbus, and the conjunctiva in the anterior segment, protect the eye by providing the first
line of physical and immunological defense against harmful materials (Lim et al., 2015). However, recurrent
erosions, corneal dystrophies, stem cell deficiency, infection by microorganisms, and autoimmune mediated
diseases all disrupt the ocular surface and can lead to severe inflammation with immune cells recruitment,
loss of corneal clarity, scarring and eventually blindness if not properly treated (Stepp and Menko, 2021).

During the last three decades, many studies have focused on the anti-inflammatory effects of purified
cannabidiol (CBD), the major non psychoactive ingredient of Cannabis, in various animal disease models,
including rheumatoid arthritis (Malfait et al., 2000), diabetes type 1 (Weiss et al., 2008) and multiple
sclerosis (Kozela et al., 2011). Nevertheless, reports on its efficacy in ocular surface inflammations are
limited to a single study, in a corneal injury model, that evaluated the antinociceptive and antiinflammatory effects of a topically administered 5% CBD solution in soybean oil (Thapa et al., 2018). Thus,
the pharmacodynamical effects of CBD on other ocular inflammation models, as well as lower CBD
concentrations, should be investigated. Furthermore, assuming that CBD is efficacious in inflammatory
ocular disorders, its impact on intraocular pressure (IOP) must be determined before considering it as a
potential therapeutic option. Indeed, reports on the subject are conflicting, as some indicate that CBD does
not affect IOP (Elsohly et al., 1984, Green et al., 1982, Liu and Dacus, 1987, Waller et al., 1984), others show
that CBD reduces IOP (Colasanti et al., 1984, Green et al., 1978) while two studies reveal an increase in IOP
due to topical CBD instillation (Miller et al., 2018, Tomida et al., 2006). This potential side-effect is critical, as
elevated IOP is the main risk factor in the pathogenesis of glaucoma (Sit and Liu, 2009), a leading cause of
blindness in developed countries (Sun et al., 2022).
Effective topical ocular drug delivery remains challenging due to the various, dynamic, anatomical and
physiological barriers that protect the eye from noxious insults (Gote et al., 2019). Indeed, in the anterior
part of the globe, tear film turn-over, nasolacrimal and conjunctival drainage, along with blinking lead to a
precorneal drug half-time of 1–3 min (López-Machado et al., 2021), thereby decreasing considerably the
formulation corneal contact time (Lakhani et al., 2018). Furthermore, these mechanisms divert the
molecules to the systemic circulation, engendering adverse reactions and further reducing the ocular drug
bioavailability to less than 5% of the dose applied (Agrahari et al., 2016).
To overcome these barriers, various nano delivery systems were investigated. Amongst them,
nanoemulsions (NEs) which are colloidal dispersions of, generally, two immiscible liquids stabilized by
surfactants, have several advantages (Gawin-Mikołajewicz et al., 2021). In addition of being kinetically
stable, their small droplets size provides a large contact area with the eyeball. Besides, the presence of
surface-active ingredients in the NEs enables enhanced mixing of the nanodroplets with the precorneal
constituents and consequently a greater dispersion of the drug over the cornea. Altogether, this results in a
prolonged contact time of the drug with the corneal epithelium, improve its absorption and leads to a
localized therapeutic effect with a rapid onset of action (Navarro-Partida et al., 2021). Additionally, these
carriers can include both hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds (Kaur and Kakkar, 2014, Shah et al.,
2019).
CBD is a phytocannabinoid that is practically insoluble in water (Ladha et al., 2020), exhibiting a log P of 6.3
(Odi et al., 2020). Thus, its formulation into simple aqueous ophthalmic solutions is not feasible. In addition,
this intrinsic characteristic eases the drug’s penetration through capillary walls, resulting in unwanted
systemic absorption of the drug that reduces the topical effect (Abdul Nasir et al., 2016). To the best of our
knowledge, few studies reported the CBD loading in colloidal lipid emulsions (Francke et al., 2021),

nanoemulsions (Banerjee et al., 2021), and self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery systems (De Prá et al., 2021,
Kok et al., 2022). Nevertheless, in all these reports, the CBD formulations aimed to oral (Banerjee et al., 2021,
De Prá et al., 2021, Kok et al., 2022) or parenteral (Francke et al., 2021) delivery but no report was found on
ocular application. Current commercially available CBD preparations include oil- and alcohol-based
solutions of various concentrations that are not adapted to the ocular physiologic requirements and can
even lead to irritation. Moreover, CBD undergoes oxidation and degradation, particularly when exposed to
light and elevated temperatures (Millar et al., 2020). Consequently, there is an unmet need for a stable CBD
delivery system, suitable for topical ophthalmic application, and able to effectively circumvent the ocular
barriers to achieve a local anti-inflammatory therapeutic effect without raising IOP.

Materials
Cannabidiol (CBD, 99.9% purity) was purchased from Symrise AG (Holzminden, Germany). Castor oil and
medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) were obtained from TAMAR Industries (Rishon LeTsiyon, Israel).
Polysorbate 80 (Tween® 80), propyl gallate, butylhydroxytoluene (BHT), Pseudomonas aeruginosa
Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) were acquired from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis,

Physicochemical characterization of the NEs
To find the optimal formulation, numerous nanoemulsions were prepared by varying mainly the oil,
antioxidant, and glycerin contents. All the selected preparations (Table 1) exhibited appropriate
physicochemical characteristics with a mean droplet diameter under 200 nm and a narrow size distribution
(PDI < 0.2), enhancing the drug’s ocular absorption through the corneal epithelial cells via endocytosis
(Danaei et al., 2018, Gawin-Mikołajewicz et al., 2021). Furthermore, the zeta potential (ZP)…

Conclusions
In our study, we successfully designed and optimized a CBD nanoemulsion exhibiting appropriate
physicochemical characteristics for ocular physiologic requirements. This formulation at high drug
concentrations, starting from 0.4%, reduced key inflammatory markers of LPS induced keratitis, an ocular
surface inflammation. Furthermore, we showed that at 0.4% and 1.6%, the IOP was decreased while it was
not affected at 0.8%. These results indicate that patients could benefit from a well-designed CBD …

selective corneal barrier is challenging. Therefore, various CBD nanoemulsions (NEs) were designed and
evaluated for stability in accelerated conditions. Further, the optimal formulation was tested on a murine
LPS-induced keratitis inflammation model. Lastly, increasing CBD concentrations were topically applied, for
two weeks, on mice eyes, for IOP measurement. CBD NEs exhibited optimal physicochemical characteristics
for ocular delivery. A specific antioxidant was required to obtain the stable, final, formulation. In vivo, 0.4 to
1.6% CBD w/v reduced the levels of key inflammatory cytokines, depending on the concentration applied.
These concentrations decreased or did not affect the IOP. Our results showed that a well-designed CBD
ocular dosage form can be stabilized for an extended shelf life. Furthermore, the significant decrease in
inflammatory cytokines levels could be exploited, provided that an adequate therapeutic dosage regimen is
identified in humans.

Introduction
Inflammation is a hallmark of many prevalent ocular surface diseases such as keratitis (Torrecilla et al.,
2018), dry eye (Yu et al., 2021) and allergic conjunctivitis (Erdinest et al., 2020). In nonpathological states,
the cornea, the limbus, and the conjunctiva in the anterior segment, protect the eye by providing the first
line of physical and immunological defense against harmful materials (Lim et al., 2015). However, recurrent
erosions, corneal dystrophies, stem cell deficiency, infection by microorganisms, and autoimmune mediated
diseases all disrupt the ocular surface and can lead to severe inflammation with immune cells recruitment,
loss of corneal clarity, scarring and eventually blindness if not properly treated (Stepp and Menko, 2021).

The dose-dependent effect of a stabilized cannabidiol nanoemulsion o…cular surface inflammation and intraocular pressure - ScienceDirect

2/19/24, 10:43 AM

During the last three decades, many studies have focused on the anti-inflammatory effects of purified
cannabidiol (CBD), the major non psychoactive ingredient of Cannabis, in various animal disease models,
including rheumatoid arthritis (Malfait et al., 2000), diabetes type 1 (Weiss et al., 2008) and multiple
sclerosis (Kozela et al., 2011). Nevertheless, reports on its efficacy in ocular surface inflammations are
limited to a single study, in a corneal injury model, that evaluated the antinociceptive and antiinflammatory effects of a topically administered 5% CBD solution in soybean oil (Thapa et al., 2018). Thus,
the pharmacodynamical effects of CBD on other ocular inflammation models, as well as lower CBD
concentrations, should be investigated. Furthermore, assuming that CBD is efficacious in inflammatory
ocular disorders, its impact on intraocular pressure (IOP) must be determined before considering it as a
potential therapeutic option. Indeed, reports on the subject are conflicting, as some indicate that CBD does
not affect IOP (Elsohly et al., 1984, Green et al., 1982, Liu and Dacus, 1987, Waller et al., 1984), others show
that CBD reduces IOP (Colasanti et al., 1984, Green et al., 1978) while two studies reveal an increase in IOP
due to topical CBD instillation (Miller et al., 2018, Tomida et al., 2006). This potential side-effect is critical, as
elevated IOP is the main risk factor in the pathogenesis of glaucoma (Sit and Liu, 2009), a leading cause of
blindness in developed countries (Sun et al., 2022).
Effective topical ocular drug delivery remains challenging due to the various, dynamic, anatomical and
physiological barriers that protect the eye from noxious insults (Gote et al., 2019). Indeed, in the anterior
part of the globe, tear film turn-over, nasolacrimal and conjunctival drainage, along with blinking lead to a
precorneal drug half-time of 1–3 min (López-Machado et al., 2021), thereby decreasing considerably the
formulation corneal contact time (Lakhani et al., 2018). Furthermore, these mechanisms divert the
molecules to the systemic circulation, engendering adverse reactions and further reducing the ocular drug
bioavailability to less than 5% of the dose applied (Agrahari et al., 2016).
To overcome these barriers, various nano delivery systems were investigated. Amongst them,
nanoemulsions (NEs) which are colloidal dispersions of, generally, two immiscible liquids stabilized by
surfactants, have several advantages (Gawin-Mikołajewicz et al., 2021). In addition of being kinetically
stable, their small droplets size provides a large contact area with the eyeball. Besides, the presence of
surface-active ingredients in the NEs enables enhanced mixing of the nanodroplets with the precorneal
constituents and consequently a greater dispersion of the drug over the cornea. Altogether, this results in a
prolonged contact time of the drug with the corneal epithelium, improve its absorption and leads to a
localized therapeutic effect with a rapid onset of action (Navarro-Partida et al., 2021). Additionally, these
carriers can include both hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds (Kaur and Kakkar, 2014, Shah et al.,
2019).
CBD is a phytocannabinoid that is practically insoluble in water (Ladha et al., 2020), exhibiting a log P of 6.3
(Odi et al., 2020). Thus, its formulation into simple aqueous ophthalmic solutions is not feasible. In addition,
this intrinsic characteristic eases the drug’s penetration through capillary walls, resulting in unwanted
systemic absorption of the drug that reduces the topical effect (Abdul Nasir et al., 2016). To the best of our
knowledge, few studies reported the CBD loading in colloidal lipid emulsions (Francke et al., 2021),

nanoemulsions (Banerjee et al., 2021), and self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery systems (De Prá et al., 2021,
Kok et al., 2022). Nevertheless, in all these reports, the CBD formulations aimed to oral (Banerjee et al., 2021,
De Prá et al., 2021, Kok et al., 2022) or parenteral (Francke et al., 2021) delivery but no report was found on
ocular application. Current commercially available CBD preparations include oil- and alcohol-based
solutions of various concentrations that are not adapted to the ocular physiologic requirements and can
even lead to irritation. Moreover, CBD undergoes oxidation and degradation, particularly when exposed to
light and elevated temperatures (Millar et al., 2020). Consequently, there is an unmet need for a stable CBD
delivery system, suitable for topical ophthalmic application, and able to effectively circumvent the ocular
barriers to achieve a local anti-inflammatory therapeutic effect without raising IOP.

Materials
Cannabidiol (CBD, 99.9% purity) was purchased from Symrise AG (Holzminden, Germany). Castor oil and
medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) were obtained from TAMAR Industries (Rishon LeTsiyon, Israel).
Polysorbate 80 (Tween® 80), propyl gallate, butylhydroxytoluene (BHT), Pseudomonas aeruginosa
Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) were acquired from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis,
USA). Macrogol 15 hydroxystearate (Solutol® HS15) was kindly donated by BASF (Ludwigshafen,
Germany).…

Physicochemical characterization of the NEs
To find the optimal formulation, numerous nanoemulsions were prepared by varying mainly the oil,
antioxidant, and glycerin contents. All the selected preparations (Table 1) exhibited appropriate
physicochemical characteristics with a mean droplet diameter under 200 nm and a narrow size distribution
(PDI < 0.2), enhancing the drug’s ocular absorption through the corneal epithelial cells via endocytosis
(Danaei et al., 2018, Gawin-Mikołajewicz et al., 2021). Furthermore, the zeta potential (ZP)…

Conclusions
In our study, we successfully designed and optimized a CBD nanoemulsion exhibiting appropriate
physicochemical characteristics for ocular physiologic requirements. This formulation at high drug
concentrations, starting from 0.4%, reduced key inflammatory markers of LPS induced keratitis, an ocular
surface inflammation. Furthermore, we showed that at 0.4% and 1.6%, the IOP was decreased while it was
not affected at 0.8%. These results indicate that patients could benefit from a well-designed CBD …

People suffering from conditions like epilepsy, where there is an excess of neuron excitement, stroke, and
cardiac arrest, where there are oxygen and glucose deprivation, Alzheimer, Parkinson, and Huntington's
disease that causes metabolic and also oxidative stress-inflammatory axis; are known to be more vulnerable
to disturbances in the metabolism, and there is a lot of inadequacy in defining the inflammation's
mechanistic connections, as well as neurodegeneration and the bioenergetic deficiencies in the CNS. We
retrieved relevant studies from PubMed/ScienceDirect/Medline/Public library of science/Mendeley/Springer
link as well as Google Scholar. We used various keywords both individually and in combination with the
literature search. ‘Epidemiology of neurodegenerative disorders’, ‘neurodegenerative diseases associated
hyper inflammation’, ‘Mechanism of inflammation in neuronal cell’, ‘Involvement of SIRTin inflammation’,
‘Pathogenesis of mitochondrial associated metabolic impairment in neurons’, ‘Reactive oxygen speciesmediated mitochondrial dysfunction’ were a few of the keywords used for the search. PINCH, which is a
chronic neuro-inflammatory component that cannot be detected in matured neurons which are healthy,

neurodegeneration. We attempted to study the regulatory mechanisms that cause changes in the
bioenergetics and its neuronal defects and mitochondrial subcellular localization that are PINCH proteinmediated on the other handSIRT1, the most intensively studied sirtuin, in oxidative stress-mediated
inflammatory consequence for many diseases but very few research data explore the role of SIRT-3 for
correction of the chronic neuroinflammatory component. Thus, in this review, we investigate the very
recently identified molecules involving in the pathogenesis during stimulated oxidative stressinflammatory axis in the excitatory neuronal cell which changes brain metabolism. Simultaneously, in CNS
neurons of diseases with a component of chronic neuroinflammation which exhibit neuroprotective
response, the consequences (mechanistic and biological) of SIRT-3, could be emerging future targets for
neurodegenerative disorder treatment with impaired metabolisms.

Introduction
In the mammalian nervous system, Glutamate is the main excitatory NT and its immoderate release triggers
membrane depolarization through receptor-mediated Na+ and Ca2+influx and elevated production of
mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and superoxide in the neurons. On the other hand, initiation of
non-receptor mediated toxicity occurs by a high concentration of glutamate (extracellular) aids the
prevention of uptake of cystine inside the cells through cystine/glutamate antiporter system, which led to
reduction of intracellular cysteine and glutathione [1]. The depletion of Glutathione leads to excessive ROS
accumulation which results in oxidative stress. The mitochondrial structure and function are affected due to
the depletion of antioxidants or excessive accumulation of ROS. Rapid recovery from excitation is obtained
by neurons by the restoration of transmembrane ion gradients, replenishment of energy substrates, and
removal of ROS. The recovery is dependent upon the optimal mitochondria functioning that leads to the
generation of ATP and buffer Ca2+ transients. Furthermore, the molecular explanation of glutamate-induced
termination of progressive respiratory stimulation via mechanisms that involve activation of PARP-1, usage

of NAD+ (cystolic), a reduced matrix ATP and substrate supply that is restricted [2].
Though in conditions like epilepsy (excessive neuron excitement), stroke and cardiac arrest (deprivation of
oxygen and glucose) or AD, PD, HD (more insidious metabolic along with oxidative stress-inflammatory
axis), the mitochondria are unable to act against the stress and neurons and hence, that leads to
degeneration which leads to death [3].
On transient exposure to a limited threshold the oxidative, metabolic as well as excitatory stress levels,
neurons reciprocated in an adaptively favorable manner through uniting signaling pathways which boost
their antioxidant defense, bioenergetics as well as the ability for prevention and reparation of the damage to
the cells [4]. For instance, exposing the neurons to glutamate (low level), acts as its protective shield against
getting killed by higher glutamate levels and intermittent exercise and fasting could counteract the process
of neurodegeneration in the AD, PD, HD, epilepsy, and stroke experimental models [[5], [6], [7]]. However,
SIRT1, the most intensively studied sirtuin, in oxidative stress-mediated inflammatory consequence for
many diseases but very few research data explore the role of SIRT-3 for correction of the chronic
neuroinflammatory component. Thus, in this review, our aim to investigate the very recently identified
molecules involving in the pathogenesis during stimulated oxidative stress-inflammatory axis in the
excitatory neuronal cell which changes brain metabolism. Simultaneously, the biological and mechanistic
result of SIRT-3 neuronal expression of the CNS in conditions having component of long-term inflammation
which exhibit neuroprotective response could be an emerging future treatment target for disorders
involving neurodegeneration with metabolism impairments.

the docked complexes of these top four phytochemicals
with the IL-6 were further analyzed by Molecular
Mechanics-Generalized Born Surface Area and Molecular
Dynamic simulations, respectively. The in vivo antiin"ammatory carrageenan-induced rat paw edema
model was used for the validation of in silico results. The
maximum percentage paw edema inhibition with
petroleum ether and ethyl acetate was 70.32% and
45.05%, respectively. The in vivo anti-in"ammatory
activity con#rms the anti-in"ammatory potential of F.
carica. Therefore, it is predicted that Cyanidin-3,5diglucoside, Kaempferol-7-O-rutinoside, Cyanidin-3rhamnoglucoside, and Rutin have the potential to inhibit
the IL-6 mediator which will aid in mitigating the cytokine
storm in patients with acute in"ammations.

Signi"cance statement
The Ficus carica plant has been included in traditional
alternative systems of medicine for the treatment of
various ailments since the ancient times. Plant leaves
and fruits have profound chemical constituents
possessing anti-in"ammatory activity reported in
numerous research publications. The current study is
designed to evaluate and investigate further, the antiin"ammatory (IL-6 inhibitory) potential of F. carica from
both computational (in silico) and in vivo methods for
discovery of new and potentially better treatment. Both
in vivo and in silico studies justify the IL-6 inhibitory
activity of F. carica phytochemicals and show that they
can prevent the hyper-in"ammatory condition known as
“cytokine storm” in the patients. The most e$ective IL-6
inhibitor phytochemicals include Cyanidin-3,5diglucoside, Kaempferol-7-O-rutinoside, Cyanidin-3rhamnoglucoside, and Rutin. In the future, these
phytochemicals will require further pharmacokinetic and
toxicity studies along with clinical trials to provide a new
treatment option for patients with acute in"ammatory
conditions.

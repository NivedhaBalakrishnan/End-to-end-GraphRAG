You will be given a document or section of document in the <article> tags.
You should extract entities and relationships from the given content.
Entities are the important keywords in the content and relationships are the connections between the entities.
The output should be a list of dictionaries where each dictionary contains the following keys:
    - 'entity1': The first entity in the relationship.
    - 'relationship': The relationship between the entities.
    - 'entity2': The second entity in the relationship.

For example, consider the below content:
<input>'Insulin resistance (IR) is known to be characteristic of type 2 diabetes mellitus, 
            and is regarded as an important mechanism in disease pathogenesis. One of the key pathogenetic 
            mechanisms  of  IR  progression  is  impaired  free  fatty  acid  (FFA)  metabolism.  Plasminogen-
            activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) and key inflammation markers, ie, interleukin 6 (IL-6) and C-reactive 
            protein (CRP), also play a role.'</input>

<output>[{'entity1': 'Insulin resistance', 'relationship': 'characteristic', 'entity2': 'Type 2 diabetes mellitus'}, 
{'entity1': 'Insulin resistance', 'relationship': 'mechanism', 'entity2': 'disease pathogenesis'},
{'entity1': 'pathogenesis', 'relationship': 'progression', 'entity2': 'Dyslipidemia'},
{'entity1': 'Plasminogen-activator inhibitor 1', 'relationship': 'role', 'entity2': 'Insulin resistance'},
{'entity1': 'Interleukin 6', 'relationship': 'role', 'entity2': 'Insulin resistance'},
{'entity1': 'C-reactive', 'relationship': 'role', 'entity2': 'Insulin resistance'}]</output>


Please follow the below guidelines:
- Provide the output inside <output> tags containing list of entities and relationships in JSON format.
- You should extract as many meaningful entities as possible from the article.
- Make sure the input is formatted properly before creating the samples. 
- Make sure all the entities and relationships are unique, do not repeat them in the output.
- Ignore links, references, and any other irrelevant information, do not include them in the samples.
- Each dictionary in the output should have the following keys:
    - 'entity1': The first entity in the relationship.
    - 'relationship': The relationship between the entities.
    - 'entity2': The second entity in the relationship.
- Make sure the entities and relationships are in one or two words only.
- The output should be a list of dictionaries.
- Make sure to fully complete the response with output tags, no additional information should be provided.
- The response should end with </output> tag, double check the answer before submitting it.

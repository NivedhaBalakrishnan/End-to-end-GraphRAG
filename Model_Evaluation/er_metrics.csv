What role do mast cells play in initiating and directing the host's immune response?,"
text: Statement of signiﬁcance

Mast cells are immune regulating cells that play a crucial role in both innate and adaptive immune re- sponses. The activation of mast cells causes the release of multiple unique proﬁles of biomolecules, which are speciﬁc to both tissue and disease. These unique characteristics are tightly regulated and afford a localized stimulus for targeting inﬂammatory diseases. Herein, these important mast cell attributes are discussed in the frame of highlighting strategies for the design of bioresponsive functional materials to target regions of inﬂammations.

1.	Introduction

Mast cells are central to the initiation, ampliﬁcation, and reg- ulation of inﬂammation. Mast cell action can be both beneﬁcial and harmful to the host: the protection against pathogenic inva- sions [1,2], or being complicit in allergy and autoimmune diseases, respectively [3–6]. Primarily localized in tissues that contact the external environment, mast cell populations may differ from one tissue to another, and are dynamic in response to environmental cues. The number of mast cells in the tissue drastically increases during inﬂammatory events, as observed in the: (i) airways and lungs of pulmonary vascular diseases (PVD) and asthmatic patients [7,8]; (ii) skin of atopic dermatitis patients [9–13]; (iii) synovial tis- sue of osteoarthritic patients [14]; and (iv) cancerous tissue during metastasis [15,16].

Mast cells play a pivotal role in initiating and directing host’s immune response. They reside in tissues that primarily interface with the external environment. Activated mast cells respond to environmental cues throughout acute and chronic inﬂammation through releasing immune mediators via rapid degran- ulation, or long-term de novo expression. Mast cell activation results in the rapid release of a variety of unique enzymes and reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, the increased density of mast cell unique receptors like mas related G protein-coupled receptor X2 also characterizes the inﬂamed tissues.

We discuss here the increased concentration of mast cell released enzymes during inﬂammation and survey their respective substrates for the express purpose of designing materials for therapeutic application. In addition to the enzymes, activated mast cells also witness elevated levels of intra- and extracellular ROS. Given the fact that ROS production, by mast cell or macrophage, occurs early in the inﬂammatory response, it is possible to target local sites of inﬂammation at the earliest stages. Consequently, the design and development of ROS respon- sive materials have also been discussed. Finally, the increased den- sity of mast cell MRGPRX2 receptor in diseased states have been discussed along with ideas on exploiting this receptor for targeted therapeutic approaches. The physiochemical characteristics of pep- tide ligands for MRGPRX2 is well elucidated, thus, their use as homing peptides to the inﬂamed tissue has been discussed.","Activated mast cells respond to environmental cues during

text: 2.	Mast cell speciﬁc enzymes as inﬂammatory stimulus

Mast cell activation results in the rapid release of preformed granular enzymes like β-hex, tryptase, and chymase, which have a speciﬁc and well-deﬁned activity against a limited set of substrates (Fig. 1). Chronic activation of mast cells induces the de novo ex- pression and release of metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), among other mediators, which digests gelatin and collagen. Herein, these en- zymes and their substrates are discussed in terms of their use in developing bioactive materials to target regions of active inﬂam- mation.

Activated mast cells rapidly degranulate to release bioactive molecules from their secretory granules [1,17–19]. Mast cell activa- tion were thought to be orchestrated through the FcɛRI, and other ligand speciﬁc receptors like Toll like Receptors (TLR), KIT receptor, and C5a and C3a complement receptors [20–22]. However, the re- cently identiﬁed mas related G protein-coupled receptor X2 (MRG- PRX2) on mast cells has been shown to initiate mast cell activa- tion against a variety of endogenous and synthetic peptides, and approved drugs [23,24].

Mast cell activation results in the rapid release of preformed granular enzymes like β-hex, tryptase, and chymase, which have a speciﬁc and well-deﬁned activity against a limited set of substrates (Fig. 1). Chronic activation of mast cells induces the de novo ex- pression and release of metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), among other mediators, which digests gelatin and collagen. Herein, these en- zymes and their substrates are discussed in terms of their use in developing bioactive materials to target regions of active inﬂam- mation.

What happens to the density of mast cell unique receptors like MRGPRX2 during chronic mast cell activation?,"
text: 6.	Mast cell MRGPRX2 as inﬂamed tissue speciﬁc receptor for targeted therapies

MRGPRX2 is predominantly expressed by mast cells, but has also been reported to be found on sensory neurons, and other im- mune cells (i.e. basophils and eosinophils); however, their expres- sion on unstimulated immune cells have been reported to be neg- ligible [155,156]. MRGPRX2 offers a direct route of mast cell acti- vation, in parallel with the immunoglobulin mediated FcɛRI acti- vation pathway, to cause mast cell degranulation [23,34,157]. The expression proﬁle of this receptor on mast cell has been shown to vary with mast cell subclass (dominant in MCTC , but not in MCT ) and anatomical sites in normal physiological conditions, as well with disease conditions [158,159]. Increased density of mast cell MRGPRX2 receptor has been shown in the lung mast cells of patients with asthma [34]; and skin mast cells of patients with atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, urticaria and prurigo [11,160,161]. Fur- thermore, MRGPRX2 has been shown to be responsible for ad- verse drug allergies as shown in the case of peptide drugs like icatibant, atracurim, antibiotics like ciproﬂoxacin [23,162]; and peri-operative drugs like morphine, vanomycine and cisatracurium [163].
Recent studies have identiﬁed several small molecules, antibod- ies, and peptide ligands which are speciﬁc to MRGPRX2 recep- tor [164–166]. The presence of the ‘distinct core structure’ within the amino acid sequence that activates MRGPRX2 allows for spe- ciﬁc targeting of the cells [167–169]. Taking this further, our group has proposed a generalized structure to design MRGPRX2 speciﬁc peptides with varied mast cell activating potential. An optimized core peptide structure which can activate mast cell MRGPRX2 re-
ceptor can be deduced to Xa-(Y)(n ≥ 3)-Xb where - Xa is an aro- matic residue; Xb is a hydrophobic residue; and Y is a minimum

3 residue long sequence, containing a minimum of one positively charged residue with the remainder being uncharged residues [24]. Table 5 lists several MRGPRX2 speciﬁc peptide with varying activ- ity towards mast cells. These peptide motifs may be utilized in multiple ways, including as homing peptides as well as a direct way to control the activity of mast cells within the extracellular milieu [170,171]. The idea of targeting a diseased tissue through peptide ligand is already in practice and has been widely used in applications like cargo delivery, detection, and imaging [172]. We herein will highlight a few of the approaches involving the use of synthetic integrin recognizing peptides, as a means of elucidating
 
potential strategies to target inﬂammation using the MRGPRX2 re- ceptor (Fig. 6).

6.1.	Strategies around mast cell MRGPRX2 peptide ligands for targeted delivery

Cell recognition peptides for cancerous tissues have been iden- tiﬁed and are routinely used in cancer research [172]. Tissue target- ing peptides attached to the surface of iron oxide nanoparticles al- lows for magnetic resonance imaging of cancerous tissue [173,174]. DOX loaded, gold coated, silica nanoparticles were decorated with
 

 

Fig. 6. Cartoon representation of mast cell showing expression of MRGPRX2 receptor on its surface. MRGPRX2 can be used a cell speciﬁc receptor to speciﬁcally target mast cells. Several MRGPRX2 peptide substrates have been identiﬁed which can be exposed onto the surface of delivery systems to localize the delivery in and around inﬂammatory tissue.

text: Adding to these, tethering an MRGPRX2 peptide ligand to a
therapeutic delivery system can also help in localizing the drug. However, targeting active sites of inﬂammation using MRGPRX2 re- ceptors poses the risk of causing partial, or complete, mast cell ac- tivation. Though mast cell activation could be beneﬁcial in certain cases [171], its activation could aggravate inﬂammatory conditions. The use of MRGPRX2 speciﬁc peptides in targeting a disease would entail a tradeoff between the therapeutic eﬃciency and the poten- tial for induced cell activation. It is therefore necessary to critically examine the therapeutic outcome while using MRGPRX2 speciﬁc peptides for cell targeting. Lastly, the binding aﬃnity of MRGPRX2 peptide ligands needs to be determined to eﬃciently target an in- ﬂamed tissue.

text: Targeted therapies are beneﬁcial, whereby, the therapeutic eﬃ- ciency is increased and the undesirable side effects are minimized. This approach has the potential to reduce health complications and economic burden, whilst increasing patient quality of life. Since mast cells play a crucial role in host immune response, and in the pathogenesis of several inﬂammatory diseases, they provide an ex- cellent approach to design and develop therapeutics around them. Mast cell released immune mediators discerns the diseased tissue milieu from the rest of the body, and provide opportunity to tar- get a disease at the onset of its progression. In the present article, we have highlighted various ways that inﬂammation could be tar- geted through utilizing unique mast cell properties. Activated mast cells triggers the rapid and local release of enzymes like β-hex, tryptase, chymase and MMP-9 in the tissue microenvironment. The enzymes discussed are both versatile (β-hex, tryptase and MMP- 9) and disease/tissue selective (chymase), which allows us to de- sign therapeutic systems for highly controlled outcomes. We have

In the preceding sections, we have highlighted enzymes that are released from mast cells upon cell activation, and which could serve as localized stimuli for inﬂammatory diseases. Next, we have identiﬁed substrates, or the physiochemical characteristics of amino acids which could be used to construct enzyme respective peptide substrates, for the development of bioresponsive materi- als. Starting with identiﬁed enzyme substrates, we also overview general approaches previously used to develop stimuli responsive therapeutics for a variety of biomedical applications for the express purpose of drawing parallels to how these strategies may be used to target inﬂammation.

Mast cells play a pivotal role in initiating and directing host’s immune response. They reside in tissues that primarily interface with the external environment. Activated mast cells respond to environmental cues throughout acute and chronic inﬂammation through releasing immune mediators via rapid degran- ulation, or long-term de novo expression. Mast cell activation results in the rapid release of a variety of unique enzymes and reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, the increased density of mast cell unique receptors like mas related G protein-coupled receptor X2 also characterizes the inﬂamed tissues. The presence of these molecules (either released mediators or surface receptors) are particular to the sites of active inﬂammation, and are a result of mast cell activation. Herein, the molecular design principles for capitalizing on these novel mast cell properties is discussed with the goal of manipulating localized inﬂammation.

text: 2.1.1.	Enzyme composition, mast cell population and dynamics
β-hex is a key marker of mast cell activation and is routinely used to study mast cell activation in the presence of any speciﬁc or general agonists [23,36]. Release of β-hex has been shown to be proportional to the concentration of agonist, where minutes af- ter activation 45 – 62% of the 3.8 U of β-hex stored in the secre- tory granules of 106 lung mast cells is released, and ﬁnally plateaus at 86% of the total granulated β-hex [37,39,54]. Furthermore, mast cells can resupply their compliment of bioactive molecules in the granules within a 24 h timeframe and can undergo successive de- granulation, releasing similar amounts of β-hex each time [38].
Mast cell degranulation also releases preformed tryptase and chymase into the tissue milieu. Though tryptase has also been shown to be expressed by monocytes and basophils, mast cell re-
lease is the dominant source: monocytes predominantly release in- active α-tryptase, and basophil tryptase is < 1% of that contained
 
in mast cells [40,55]. Mast cells are classiﬁed into two subpopula- tions, viz., (i) MCTC – mast cell containing both tryptase and chy- mase, and (ii) MCT – mast cell predominantly containing tryptase [56]. Further, it has been shown that about 79% of total tryptase contained in human lung MCT cells are released upon the activa- tion [39]. When designing strategies for affecting localized inﬂam- mation through mast cell properties, it is important to recognize that mast cell subpopulations vary with tissue type. For example, MCTC are the dominant mast cell population in skin and intesti- nal submucosa, accounting for 89 and 87% of the total mast cell population respectively; on the contrary, lung and intestinal mu- cosa mast cells are predominantly MCT (∼100%) [41,56]. Moreover, the granular composition of serine enzymes have been shown to vary with tissue type; skin mast cells (106 cells) contain 35 and","The two main enzymes released by mast cells upon activation

text: 2.1.1.	Enzyme composition, mast cell population and dynamics
β-hex is a key marker of mast cell activation and is routinely used to study mast cell activation in the presence of any speciﬁc or general agonists [23,36]. Release of β-hex has been shown to be proportional to the concentration of agonist, where minutes af- ter activation 45 – 62% of the 3.8 U of β-hex stored in the secre- tory granules of 106 lung mast cells is released, and ﬁnally plateaus at 86% of the total granulated β-hex [37,39,54]. Furthermore, mast cells can resupply their compliment of bioactive molecules in the granules within a 24 h timeframe and can undergo successive de- granulation, releasing similar amounts of β-hex each time [38].
Mast cell degranulation also releases preformed tryptase and chymase into the tissue milieu. Though tryptase has also been shown to be expressed by monocytes and basophils, mast cell re-
lease is the dominant source: monocytes predominantly release in- active α-tryptase, and basophil tryptase is < 1% of that contained
 
in mast cells [40,55]. Mast cells are classiﬁed into two subpopula- tions, viz., (i) MCTC – mast cell containing both tryptase and chy- mase, and (ii) MCT – mast cell predominantly containing tryptase [56]. Further, it has been shown that about 79% of total tryptase contained in human lung MCT cells are released upon the activa- tion [39]. When designing strategies for affecting localized inﬂam- mation through mast cell properties, it is important to recognize that mast cell subpopulations vary with tissue type. For example, MCTC are the dominant mast cell population in skin and intesti- nal submucosa, accounting for 89 and 87% of the total mast cell population respectively; on the contrary, lung and intestinal mu- cosa mast cells are predominantly MCT (∼100%) [41,56]. Moreover, the granular composition of serine enzymes have been shown to vary with tissue type; skin mast cells (106 cells) contain 35 and

text: 2.1.2.	Substrate considerations for β-hex
β-hex is a lysosomal enzyme that promotes the hydrolysis of 1,4 glycosidic bonds in glycosaminoglycans [58]. Chitin, a β-1,4 glucoside linked N-acetylglucosamine polysaccharide, a microbial cell wall component, is therefore an ideal substrate for β-hex [59–61]. However, research has shown that β-hex only processes hydrolyzed colloidal and ground chitin (i.e., short chain chitin- oligosaccharides (COS)) [62,63]. The catalytic activity of the en- zyme sequentially removes monomers from the non-reducing end of the chain to furnish monomeric N-acetylglucosamine as the end product (Fig. 2) [62,64,65]. The kinetic parameters for mast cell sourced β-hex against COS has not been detailed, but β-hex de- rived from other sources have shown varying degradation kinetics for COS of 2 to 6 degrees of polymerization (DP). β-hex cloned from bacteria Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Vibrio harveyi had a Kcat/Km value of 246 and 166 M−1s−1 respectively for DP6 chitin; the Vmax and Km value for Vibrio furnissi β-hex against DP6 chitin was found to be 3.5 mM and 376 μmol-min−1mg−1, respec- tively [62,65,66]. The kinetic values were obtained for a range of pH between 5 to 8, and temperature between 30 to 40 ͦC, mean- ing that this function could be expected in physiological situations with mast cell derived β-hex. Further, the catalytic activity of β- hex is mediated by the 2-acetamide group present in the monomer unit of its substrate, without which the enzymatic activity is inhib- ited (Fig. 2a) [58,64]. Chitin derivatives, like chitosan in its acety- lated form, and hyaluronic acid, thus are commonly engineered

Serine proteases and β-hex are preformed granular components of mast cells and exert their catalytic activities on peptide substrates and chitin oligomers, respectively. MMP-9 is synthesized upon mast cell activation and degrades gelatin and collagen.


Fig. 2. a) Substrate assisted mechanism of β-hexosaminidase. The monomers of chitin are removed successively by the hydrolysis of 1,4 glycosidic bond. The enzyme favours the carbonyl group on the acetamide of the monomer from non-reducing terminal to acts as a nucleophile, and attacks the C1 carbon of the terminal monomer. Thereafter the enzyme facilitates the attack of a water molecule at C1 causing the hydrolysis of the 1,4 glycosidic bond.

2.1.3.	Substrate considerations for tryptase
It is evident that the spatiotemporally controlled release of tryptase upon mast cell activation is a cardinal event in an inﬂam-
 
matory condition, yet there remains a dearth in the literature on utilizing this enzyme as a means to trigger latent functionalities programmed within a bioresponsive material. Scope of these ma- terials in therapeutic applications are huge, be it for drug delivery, presentation of occult amino acid residues for cell signaling, de- struction of cell signaling molecules, among others.

Differences in the relative composition of mast cell populations and their respective enzyme proﬁles provide a novel design strategy for developing therapeutics that can be locally activated in speciﬁc inﬂamed tissues.
Mast cell populations are dynamic and vary with disease type and severity. For example, mast cell population transition from predominantly MCT in healthy subjects to MCTC in patients with asthma and pulmonary diseases, and the extent of this change is directly related to disease severity [7,8,43,44,57]. Situations like this provide a unique trigger for targeted release, where the tis- sue has elevated levels of chymase during the time for treating the
disease. On the contrary, osteoarthritis has an increased population of MCT (77%) cells in the human synovial tissue (81 in patients vs. 24-32 cells/mm2 in controls), compared to controls [14]. Similarly, human scar tissue has a dramatic increase in MCT skin mast cells, increasing to 91% from 11% in a normal skin tissue [41]. This is not always the case though and the mast cell proﬁle for each dis- ease needs to be characterized. Tryptase, for example, though was at an increased level in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) ﬂuid of patients with asthma when compared to the control, the relative level of tryptase did not change with disease severity [57]. These examples illustrate situations where chymase and tryptase levels vary depending on disease location and state, allowing for speciﬁc and local targeting of affected tissues.

text: Statement of signiﬁcance

Mast cells are immune regulating cells that play a crucial role in both innate and adaptive immune re- sponses. The activation of mast cells causes the release of multiple unique proﬁles of biomolecules, which are speciﬁc to both tissue and disease. These unique characteristics are tightly regulated and afford a localized stimulus for targeting inﬂammatory diseases. Herein, these important mast cell attributes are discussed in the frame of highlighting strategies for the design of bioresponsive functional materials to target regions of inﬂammations.

1.	Introduction

Mast cells are central to the initiation, ampliﬁcation, and reg- ulation of inﬂammation. Mast cell action can be both beneﬁcial and harmful to the host: the protection against pathogenic inva- sions [1,2], or being complicit in allergy and autoimmune diseases, respectively [3–6]. Primarily localized in tissues that contact the external environment, mast cell populations may differ from one tissue to another, and are dynamic in response to environmental cues. The number of mast cells in the tissue drastically increases during inﬂammatory events, as observed in the: (i) airways and lungs of pulmonary vascular diseases (PVD) and asthmatic patients [7,8]; (ii) skin of atopic dermatitis patients [9–13]; (iii) synovial tis- sue of osteoarthritic patients [14]; and (iv) cancerous tissue during metastasis [15,16].

Mast cells play a pivotal role in initiating and directing host’s immune response. They reside in tissues that primarily interface with the external environment. Activated mast cells respond to environmental cues throughout acute and chronic inﬂammation through releasing immune mediators via rapid degran- ulation, or long-term de novo expression. Mast cell activation results in the rapid release of a variety of unique enzymes and reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, the increased density of mast cell unique receptors like mas related G protein-coupled receptor X2 also characterizes the inﬂamed tissues. The presence of these molecules (either released mediators or surface receptors) are particular to the sites of active inﬂammation, and are a result of mast cell activation. Herein, the molecular design principles for capitalizing on these novel mast cell properties is discussed with the goal of manipulating localized inﬂammation.

Mast cells are central to the initiation, ampliﬁcation, and reg- ulation of inﬂammation. Mast cell action can be both beneﬁcial and harmful to the host: the protection against pathogenic inva- sions [1,2], or being complicit in allergy and autoimmune diseases, respectively [3–6]. Primarily localized in tissues that contact the external environment, mast cell populations may differ from one tissue to another, and are dynamic in response to environmental cues. The number of mast cells in the tissue drastically increases during inﬂammatory events, as observed in the: (i) airways and lungs of pulmonary vascular diseases (PVD) and asthmatic patients [7,8]; (ii) skin of atopic dermatitis patients [9–13]; (iii) synovial tis- sue of osteoarthritic patients [14]; and (iv) cancerous tissue during metastasis [15,16].

Mast cells play a pivotal role in initiating and directing host’s immune response. They reside in tissues that primarily interface with the external environment. Activated mast cells respond to environmental cues throughout acute and chronic inﬂammation through releasing immune mediators via rapid degran- ulation, or long-term de novo expression. Mast cell activation results in the rapid release of a variety of unique enzymes and reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, the increased density of mast cell unique receptors like mas related G protein-coupled receptor X2 also characterizes the inﬂamed tissues. The presence of these molecules (either released mediators or surface receptors) are particular to the sites of active inﬂammation, and are a result of mast cell activation. Herein, the molecular design principles for capitalizing on these novel mast cell properties is discussed with the goal of manipulating localized inﬂammation.

text: Statement of signiﬁcance

Mast cells are immune regulating cells that play a crucial role in both innate and adaptive immune re- sponses. The activation of mast cells causes the release of multiple unique proﬁles of biomolecules, which are speciﬁc to both tissue and disease. These unique characteristics are tightly regulated and afford a localized stimulus for targeting inﬂammatory diseases. Herein, these important mast cell attributes are discussed in the frame of highlighting strategies for the design of bioresponsive functional materials to target regions of inﬂammations.

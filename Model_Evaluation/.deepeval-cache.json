Activated mast cells respond to environmental cues throughout acute and chronic in\\ufb02ammation through releasing immune mediators via rapid degran- ulation, or long-term de novo expression.

Mast cell action can be both bene\\ufb01cial and harmful to the host: the protection against pathogenic inva- sions [1,2], or being complicit in allergy and autoimmune diseases, respectively [3\\u20136]. Primarily localized in tissues that contact the external environment, mast cell populations may differ from one tissue to another, and are dynamic in response to environmental cues. The number of mast cells in the tissue drastically increases during in\\ufb02ammatory events, as observed in the: (i) airways and lungs of pulmonary vascular diseases (PVD) and asthmatic patients [7,8]; (ii) skin of atopic dermatitis patients [9\\u201313]; (iii) synovial tis- sue of osteoarthritic patients [14]; and (iv) cancerous tissue during metastasis [15,16]. The aberrational surge in the number of mast\", \"\\ntext: Targeted therapies are bene\\ufb01cial, whereby, the therapeutic e\\ufb03- ciency is increased and the undesirable side effects are minimized. This approach has the potential to reduce health complications and economic burden, whilst increasing patient quality of life. Since mast cells play a crucial role in host immune response, and in the pathogenesis of several in\\ufb02ammatory diseases, they provide an ex- cellent approach to design and develop therapeutics around them. Mast cell released immune mediators discerns the diseased tissue milieu from the rest of the body, and provide opportunity to tar- get a disease at the onset of its progression. In the present article, we have highlighted various ways that in\\ufb02ammation could be tar- geted through utilizing unique mast cell properties. Activated mast cells triggers the rapid and local release of enzymes like \\u03b2-hex, tryptase, chymase and MMP-9 in the tissue microenvironment. The enzymes discussed are both versatile (\\u03b2-hex, tryptase and MMP- 9) and disease/tissue selective (chymase), which allows us to de- sign therapeutic systems for highly controlled outcomes.
